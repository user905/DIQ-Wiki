The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Minimum Impact Cost Dollars Greater Than Likely Dollars" is performed on the DS16 Risk Register Tasks dataset. This check is designed to ensure that the minimum impact cost in dollars is not greater than the likely impact cost in dollars.

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it indicates that there are instances where the minimum impact cost (recorded in the 'impact_cost_minimum_dollars' field) is greater than the likely impact cost (recorded in the 'impact_cost_likely_dollars' field). This is a logical inconsistency, as we would expect the minimum impact cost to be less than or equal to the likely impact cost.

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the 'impact_cost_minimum_dollars' and 'impact_cost_likely_dollars' fields for any anomalies or errors. Ensure that the values entered align with the expectation that the minimum impact cost should not exceed the likely impact cost.

This test is being performed to ensure that the minimum impact cost in dollars is not greater than the likely impact cost in dollars in the DS16 Risk Register Tasks table. The importance of this check is to maintain the logical consistency of the data. In a risk register, the minimum impact cost should logically be less than or equal to the likely impact cost. If the minimum cost is greater, it could indicate a data entry error or a misunderstanding of the risk assessment process. 

The severity of this test is marked as an MINOR, which means it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, but it could potentially cause minor problems in the analysis or indicate that the data doesn't follow all best practices. It's important to address this issue to ensure accurate risk assessment and effective project management.
