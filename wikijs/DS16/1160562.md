The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Impact Missing Impact Value" is designed to identify any instances in the DS16 Risk Register Tasks where an impact task is missing a value related to its impact on cost and/or schedule. 

The fields that this check focuses on are: impact_schedule_min_days, impact_schedule_likely_days, impact_schedule_max_days, impact_cost_min_dollars, impact_cost_likely_dollars, and impact_cost_max_dollars. If any of these fields are missing a value (i.e., the value is null or zero), the DIQ check will flag this as an issue.

The likely cause of this error is that when the impact task was entered into the DS16 Risk Register Tasks, not all necessary fields were filled out. This could be due to oversight, incomplete data, or a misunderstanding of the required fields.

The expected values for these fields would be any non-zero numerical value that accurately reflects the potential impact on the project's schedule or cost. For example, the impact_schedule_min_days field should contain the minimum number of days that the task could potentially delay the project, while the impact_cost_max_dollars field should contain the maximum potential cost impact of the task.

To resolve this issue, ensure that all necessary fields are filled out when entering impact tasks into the DS16 Risk Register Tasks.

This test is being performed on the 'DS16 Risk Register Tasks' table to check if any impact task is missing an impact value on cost and/or schedule. The test is looking for missing values in any of the following fields: impact_schedule_min_days, impact_schedule_likely_days, impact_schedule_max_days, impact_cost_min_dollars, impact_cost_likely_dollars, or impact_cost_max_dollars. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that all impact tasks have been properly quantified in terms of their potential impact on the project's cost and schedule. Without this information, it would be difficult to accurately assess the overall risk of the project and to plan accordingly. 

The severity of this check is classified as an MINOR. This means that while missing values may not prevent the data from being reviewed, they could potentially cause minor problems during analysis or indicate that the data does not fully adhere to best practices. It is therefore recommended to address these issues to ensure the highest quality and integrity of the project management data.
