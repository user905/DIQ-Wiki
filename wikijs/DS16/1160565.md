The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Impact Cost Dollar Spread Missing" is performed on the DS16 Risk Register Tasks table. This check is designed to ensure that the minimum, likely, and maximum impact cost dollars are not all equivalent. 

If an error is flagged by this check, it means that the values in the fields 'impact_cost_minimum_dollars', 'impact_cost_likely_dollars', and 'impact_cost_max_dollars' are all the same. This is not expected as these fields should represent a range of potential costs, not a single fixed value. 

The 'impact_cost_minimum_dollars' should ideally be less than the 'impact_cost_likely_dollars', which in turn should be less than the 'impact_cost_max_dollars'. This spread of values allows for a more accurate representation of the potential financial impact of risks. 

If these fields are all equal, it suggests that the data may not have been entered correctly or that the risk assessment may not have been fully completed. It is recommended to review the data entry process for these fields to ensure that a range of potential costs is being captured.

This test is being performed on the 'DS16 Risk Register Tasks' table to check if the minimum, likely, and maximum impact cost dollars are all equivalent. The test is titled 'Impact Cost Dollar Spread Missing'. The purpose of this test is to ensure that there is a spread in the projected cost impact of risks, which is essential for accurate risk management and financial planning. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that if the minimum, likely, and maximum impact cost dollars are all the same, it could cause problems during the analysis of the data. This could potentially lead to inaccurate risk assessments and financial projections. 

The importance of this check lies in its ability to identify potential issues in the data that could affect the accuracy of risk and financial management in the EVMS construction project. It helps ensure that the data used for these critical tasks is reliable and accurate, thereby supporting effective decision-making and project management.
