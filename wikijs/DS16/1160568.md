The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Impact Schedule Day Spread Missing" is performed on the DS16 Risk Register Tasks table. This check is designed to ensure that the values for minimum, likely, and maximum impact schedule days are not all the same. 

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it means that the values for 'impact_schedule_minimum_days', 'impact_schedule_likely_days', and 'impact_schedule_max_days' are identical. This is not expected as these fields should represent a range of possible values, not a single value repeated. 

The 'impact_schedule_minimum_days' should ideally be less than the 'impact_schedule_likely_days', which in turn should be less than the 'impact_schedule_max_days'. This range of values is important to accurately reflect the potential variability in the schedule impact of risks. 

If these fields are all the same, it suggests that the data may not have been entered correctly or that the risk's impact on the schedule has not been fully assessed. Please review the data in these fields to ensure it accurately represents the expected range of schedule impacts for each risk.

This test is being performed on the 'DS16 Risk Register Tasks' table to check for the consistency in the data related to the impact schedule days. The test is checking if the minimum, likely, and maximum impact schedule days are all equivalent. This is important because if these values are all the same, it could indicate a lack of variability or uncertainty in the project risk assessment, which is not realistic in a construction project management context. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it could potentially cause problems during the analysis. For instance, if all these values are the same, it could lead to inaccurate risk modeling or flawed decision-making based on the assumption that the impact schedule days will always be the same. Therefore, this check is crucial to ensure the quality and reliability of the project risk data.
