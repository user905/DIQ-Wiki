## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Probability Schedule Min Between 92 - 98%" is performed on the DS15 Risk Register. This check is designed to ensure that the minimum probability schedule percent is within the specified range of 92% to 98%.

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that there are entries in the DS15 Risk Register where the minimum probability schedule percent is either below 92% or equal to or above 98%. This is not in line with the expected values, which should fall within the 92% to 98% range.

The field causing the issue in this case is 'probability_schedule_min_pct'. To resolve this issue, review the entries in the DS15 Risk Register and ensure that all values in the 'probability_schedule_min_pct' field are between 92% and 98%.

This test is being performed on the 'DS15 Risk Register' table to ensure that the minimum probability schedule percent falls within the range of 92% to 98%. The purpose of this check is to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the risk register data, which is crucial for effective risk management in the EVMS construction project. 

The severity level of this test is 'MINOR', which means it is not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed. However, if the minimum probability schedule percent does not fall within the specified range, it could indicate minor problems or deviations from best practices. This could potentially lead to inaccuracies in risk assessment and management, which is why this check is important.
