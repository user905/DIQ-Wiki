The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Probability Cost Min Between 92 - 98%" is performed on the DS15 Risk Register data. This check is designed to ensure that the minimum probability cost percent is within the specified range of 92% to 98%.

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that there are entries in the DS15 Risk Register where the minimum probability cost percent is either below 92% or equal to or above 98%. The field causing the issue in this case is 'probability_cost_min_pct'. 

The expected values for this field should be any decimal number between 0.92 and 0.98, inclusive of 0.92 and exclusive of 0.98. Any values outside this range will cause the DIQ check to fail. 

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the DS15 Risk Register and ensure that all values in the 'probability_cost_min_pct' field are within the specified range.

This test is being performed on the 'DS15 Risk Register' table to ensure that the minimum probability cost percent falls within the range of 92% and 98%. The importance of this check is to ensure that the risk register is accurately reflecting the potential cost risks associated with the project. If the minimum probability cost percent falls outside of this range, it could indicate that the project's risk assessment is either too conservative or too optimistic, which could lead to inaccurate planning and budgeting. The severity of this check is classified as an 'MINOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it could potentially cause minor problems or indicate that the data does not adhere to all best practices. Therefore, it is important to address this issue to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project's risk assessment.
