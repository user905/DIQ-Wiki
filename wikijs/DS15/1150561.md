The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Probability Cost Min Equal To Or Above 98%" is performed on the DS15 Risk Register data. This check is designed to ensure that the minimum probability cost percent in the data is equal to or above 98%.

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that there are entries in the Risk Register where the minimum probability cost percent is less than 98%. This could be due to data entry errors or incorrect calculations in the original data source. 

The field causing the issue is 'probability_cost_min_pct'. The expected value for this field is a percentage that is equal to or greater than 98%. Any value less than 98% would cause this DIQ check to fail. 

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the Risk Register and correct any that have a minimum probability cost percent less than 98%.

This test is being performed on the 'DS15 Risk Register' table to ensure that the minimum probability cost percent is equal to or above 98%. The severity of this test is marked as a 'MAJOR', which implies that if the minimum probability cost percent is not maintained at or above 98%, it could lead to problems during the analysis of the data.

The importance of this check lies in maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the risk register data. The risk register is a crucial component of project management, especially in EVMS construction projects, as it helps in identifying, assessing, and managing potential risks. If the minimum probability cost percent is not maintained at a high level, it could indicate that the risk assessment is not being conducted thoroughly, which could lead to underestimation of potential risks and consequently, inadequate risk management strategies. Therefore, this check ensures that the risk assessment is being conducted rigorously and the data integrity is maintained.
