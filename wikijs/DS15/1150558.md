The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Realized Date After Closed Date" is performed on the DS15 Risk Register data. This check is designed to ensure that the date a risk is realized (realized_date) is not recorded as being after the date the risk was closed (closed_date). 

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it indicates that there are entries in the DS15 Risk Register where the realized_date is later than the closed_date. This is not expected as a risk should be realized before or at the time it is closed. 

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the DS15 Risk Register and correct any instances where the realized_date is recorded as being after the closed_date. The expected values for these fields should reflect that a risk is realized before or at the same time it is closed.

This test is being performed on the 'DS15 Risk Register' table to check if the 'realized date' of a risk is after the 'closed date'. The test is designed to ensure that the sequence of events is logical and accurate, as a risk cannot be realized after it has been closed. 

The importance of this check is to maintain the integrity and quality of the data. If the realized date is after the closed date, it could lead to incorrect analysis and conclusions about the risk management process. This could potentially impact decision-making and the overall success of the EVMS construction project.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MINOR'. This means that while it is not a critical error that would prevent the data from being reviewed, it is still a potential issue that could cause minor problems or indicate that the data does not follow all best practices. It is a signal to review the data and correct any inconsistencies to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.
