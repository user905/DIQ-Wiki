Test Title: Early Start Later Than Late Start

This Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check is performed on the DS04 Schedule table. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the Early Start date (ES_date) of a task is not later than the Late Start date (LS_date). 

In a well-structured project schedule, the Early Start date should always be earlier or equal to the Late Start date. If the Early Start date is later, it indicates a scheduling error that could lead to project delays or mismanagement.

If this test fails, it means that there are tasks in the DS04 Schedule table where the Early Start date is later than the Late Start date. This could be due to data entry errors or incorrect scheduling. 

To resolve this issue, review the tasks identified by this test and correct the start dates as necessary. The Early Start date should be set to a date that is earlier or equal to the Late Start date.

This test is being performed to ensure that the early start date for a task in the DS04 Schedule table is not later than the late start date. This is a logical inconsistency as it is not possible for a task to start early if the early start date is later than the late start date. 

The importance of this check is to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project schedule data. If this issue is not addressed, it could lead to incorrect project planning and scheduling, which could in turn lead to delays and cost overruns. 

The severity of this check is marked as MAJOR, which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis of the project schedule. Therefore, it is recommended to fix this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
