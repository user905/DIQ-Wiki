Test Title: Early Finish Later Than Late Finish

Test Summary: This test checks if the early finish date (EF_date) of a task in the DS04 Schedule table is later than the late finish date (LF_date). 

Error Message: EF_date > LF_date.

Explanation: This test is designed to ensure the integrity and quality of the project schedule data. In a well-structured project schedule, the early finish date of a task should never be later than the late finish date. If this test fails, it indicates that there are tasks in the DS04 Schedule table where the early finish date is later than the late finish date. 

This could be due to a data entry error or a scheduling issue. The fields causing the issue are the EF_date (Early Finish Date) and LF_date (Late Finish Date). The expected values should be such that the EF_date is either equal to or earlier than the LF_date for all tasks. 

To resolve this issue, review the tasks identified by this test and correct the early finish and late finish dates as necessary. Ensure that the early finish date is not later than the late finish date for any task.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check if there are any instances where the 'Early Finish' date is later than the 'Late Finish' date. In project management, the 'Early Finish' date is the earliest point in time when a task can be completed, while the 'Late Finish' date is the latest point in time when a task can be completed without delaying the project. 

The importance of this check is to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the project schedule. If the 'Early Finish' date is later than the 'Late Finish' date, it indicates a scheduling error that could potentially lead to project delays or mismanagement. 

The severity of this check is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis of the project schedule. Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue to ensure accurate and effective project management.
