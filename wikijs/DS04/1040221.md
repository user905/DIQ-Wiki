## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Insufficient WBS Justification" is designed to ensure that each task in the DS04 Schedule table has a sufficient Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) justification. This is a critical aspect of project management as it provides a clear and detailed explanation of the task.

The error message "Task is lacking a sufficient WBS justification (at least two words required)" indicates that the justification provided in the 'justification_WBS' field of the DS04 Schedule table is insufficient. Specifically, the justification provided is either missing or contains less than two words. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that each task in the DS04 Schedule table has a WBS justification that is at least two words long. This will provide a more detailed explanation of the task and improve the overall quality and integrity of the project management data.

This test is being performed to ensure that each task in the DS04 Schedule table has a sufficient Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) justification. The WBS justification is crucial as it provides a detailed description of the task, which aids in understanding the scope and complexity of the task. 

The severity level of this test is an MINOR, which means that while it may not immediately prevent data analysis, it could potentially cause minor problems or indicate that the data does not adhere to all best practices. In this case, the alert is triggered because a task is lacking a sufficient WBS justification, with at least two words required. 

The importance of this check lies in maintaining the quality and integrity of the project management data. Without a sufficient WBS justification, it may be difficult to understand the task's purpose, leading to potential misunderstandings or misinterpretations during project execution or analysis. Therefore, while it's not an immediate threat to data analysis, it's a best practice to provide a sufficient WBS justification for each task to ensure clear and effective project management.
