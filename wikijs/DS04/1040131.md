The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Soft Constraint Found" is designed to identify if there are any soft constraints present in the tasks of the DS04 Schedule. A soft constraint is a scheduling parameter that guides the start or end of a task but does not strictly enforce it. 

The error message "Soft constraint found (constraint_type = CS_MSOA or CS_MEOA)" indicates that one or more tasks in the DS04 Schedule have been identified with a soft constraint. The fields causing this issue are the 'constraint_type' fields with values 'CS_MSOA' or 'CS_MEOA'. 

'CS_MSOA' stands for "Constraint Start On or After", which means the task can start on or after a specific date. 'CS_MEOA' stands for "Constraint End On or After", which means the task can end on or after a specific date. 

If these values are present in the 'constraint_type' field, it means that the tasks have a soft constraint. This may not be an issue depending on the project management approach, but it's important to be aware of these constraints as they can impact the scheduling flexibility. 

If you are expecting strict scheduling without any soft constraints, you should ensure that the 'constraint_type' field does not contain 'CS_MSOA' or 'CS_MEOA' values.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check for the presence of soft constraints in the tasks. Soft constraints, identified as 'CS_MSOA' or 'CS_MEOA', are flexible conditions that guide the scheduling of tasks but do not strictly enforce the order or timing of events. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the project schedule is not overly constrained and allows for flexibility in task execution. Over-reliance on soft constraints can lead to unrealistic or inefficient schedules, which can impact project timelines and resource allocation. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'MINOR', which means it is not a critical issue that would prevent data review or analysis. However, it is a potential concern that might cause minor problems or indicate that the data does not fully adhere to best practices for project scheduling. Therefore, it is recommended to review and adjust the use of soft constraints as necessary to optimize the project schedule.
