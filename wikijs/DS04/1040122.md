## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Task Description Contains Task ID" is designed to ensure that the task description does not contain the task ID within the DS04 Schedule table. This check is important to maintain the clarity and specificity of task descriptions, which should not be confused or conflated with task IDs.

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it means that the 'description' field in the DS04 Schedule table contains the 'task_ID'. This is not the expected behavior, as the 'description' field should contain a clear and concise description of the task, separate from the 'task_ID'. 

To resolve this issue, review the 'description' field for the flagged entries and remove any instances of the 'task_ID'. The 'description' field should only contain relevant information about the task, not numerical or coded identifiers. 

Remember, maintaining data integrity and quality is crucial for effective project management and accurate reporting. Always ensure that each field in your data tables contains the appropriate and expected information.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check if the task description contains the task ID. The severity level of this test is 'MINOR', which means it is not a critical issue but it might cause minor problems or it indicates that the data does not follow all best practices.

The importance of this check is to ensure that the task description is clear and does not contain unnecessary or redundant information such as the task ID. This is crucial for maintaining clean and understandable data. If the task ID is included in the task description, it could lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the data. Therefore, this test helps to maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data by ensuring that each field contains only the appropriate information.
