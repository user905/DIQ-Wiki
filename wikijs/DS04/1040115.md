The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Activity with Original Duration of Zero" is designed to identify any activities in the DS04 Schedule table that have an original duration of zero days. 

This check is important because an activity with a duration of zero days could indicate a data entry error or a planning oversight. In a typical project schedule, all activities should have a duration greater than zero, as they represent tasks that require time to complete.

The specific field causing the issue is 'duration_original_days'. If this field has a value of zero, it means that the original planned duration for the activity is zero days, which is not a realistic scenario for most tasks in a project schedule.

The expected value for the 'duration_original_days' field should be greater than zero. If this DIQ check identifies any activities with a duration of zero, these should be reviewed and corrected as necessary to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the project schedule data. 

Please note that this check excludes 'SM' and 'FM' types of activities, as these are typically summary or milestone activities that may legitimately have a duration of zero.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check if there are any activities with an original duration of zero. The test is important because an activity with a duration of zero could potentially cause problems during analysis. It might indicate that the activity was not properly planned or that there was an error during data entry. The severity of this issue is marked as a 'MAJOR', which means it is of moderate severity. While it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis if not addressed. Therefore, it is crucial to correct this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data.
