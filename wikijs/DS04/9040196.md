## What causes this error?

> :robot: The following text was generated by an AI tool and hasn't been reviewed for accuracy by a human! It might be useful, but it also might have errors. Are you a human? You can help by reviewing it for accuracy! Edit it as needed then remove this message.

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Milestone With Resources" is designed to verify whether milestones in the DS04 Schedule dataset are resource-loaded. A milestone is considered resource-loaded if its task ID (where the task type is either 'SM' or 'FM') is found in the DS06 Schedule Resources dataset.

If an error message is generated from this DIQ check, it indicates that there are milestones in the DS04 Schedule dataset that are not resource-loaded. This could be due to missing or incorrect data in the DS06 Schedule Resources dataset.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that each milestone task ID in the DS04 Schedule dataset has a corresponding entry in the DS06 Schedule Resources dataset. The task type for these entries should be either 'SM' or 'FM'.

This test is being performed to check if milestones in the DS04 Schedule table are resource-loaded, meaning they have associated resources allocated to them in the DS06 resources dataset. The test identifies any milestone task_IDs (where the task type is SM/FM) that are found in the resources dataset.

The importance of this check is to ensure that all milestones have the necessary resources assigned to them for successful completion. If a milestone is not resource-loaded, it could lead to delays or issues in project execution as resources are a critical component of project planning and management.

The severity of this check is marked as a MAJOR. This implies that while the issue does not make the data unreviewable, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. For instance, it could lead to inaccurate resource allocation or utilization reports, incorrect project timelines, or flawed project cost estimates. Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue to maintain the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data.
