The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CD-1 Milestone Missing in Baseline" is designed to verify the presence of the CD-1 milestone in the baseline schedule of the DS04 Schedule table. 

The CD-1 milestone is a critical component of the project schedule, and its absence could indicate a significant oversight in project planning. This milestone is identified by a milestone level of 120 in the DS04 Schedule table. 

The DIQ check is performed by counting the number of rows in the DS04 Schedule table where the schedule type is 'BL' (indicating a baseline schedule) and the milestone level is 120 (indicating the CD-1 milestone). If the count is zero, this means that the CD-1 milestone is missing from the baseline schedule.

If you encounter an error message stating "No row found for CD-1 milestone (milestone_level = 120) in baseline schedule (schedule_type = BL)", this means that the CD-1 milestone is not present in the baseline schedule. To resolve this issue, you should review your project schedule and ensure that the CD-1 milestone is included in the baseline schedule with the correct milestone level of 120.

This test is being performed to check if the baseline schedule in the DS04 Schedule table is missing the CD-1 milestone. The CD-1 milestone, also known as the "Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range" milestone, is a critical part of the project management process in the Department of Energy. It signifies the approval of the project's alternative selection and cost range, which is a crucial step in project planning and execution.

The severity of this test is marked as a MAJOR. This means that while the absence of the CD-1 milestone in the baseline schedule may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis of the project's progress and cost management. This could lead to inaccurate project tracking, budgeting, and forecasting.

Therefore, this check is important to ensure that all necessary milestones are included in the baseline schedule for accurate and effective project management. It helps in maintaining the integrity and quality of the project management data, which is essential for successful project execution and control.
