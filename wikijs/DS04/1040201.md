The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Units % Complete Type Utilized" is designed to verify whether a task in the DS04 Schedule table is using a Units % Complete type. This check is important to ensure that the progress of tasks is being measured and reported accurately.

The error message "Task uses a Units % Complete type (PC_type = Units)" indicates that the task is indeed using a Units % Complete type. This is determined by the field 'PC_type' in the DS04 Schedule table. If the 'PC_type' field is set to 'Units', it means that the task's progress is being measured in units, which is the expected value for this field.

If you encounter this error, it is likely because the 'PC_type' field for a task in the DS04 Schedule table is not set to 'Units'. To resolve this issue, you should review the tasks in the DS04 Schedule table and ensure that the 'PC_type' field for each task is set to 'Units'. This will ensure that the progress of tasks is being measured and reported in a consistent manner.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check if the tasks are using a 'Units % Complete' type. The 'Units % Complete' type is a method of measuring the progress of a task based on the proportion of units completed. This is important as it helps in tracking the progress of tasks and managing the schedule effectively.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MINOR', which is less severe. This means that while the data may not be following all best practices, it is not likely to cause significant problems during analysis. However, it is still important to address this issue to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. The use of 'Units % Complete' type might not be suitable for all tasks and could potentially lead to inaccurate progress tracking if not used appropriately.
