| Summary       | Is this activity missing an EVT?                                                                                                                     |
| Error message | activity where EVT = null or blank (Note: If task is a milestone, then type must be either FM or SM. Otherwise, it will be treated as an activity.). |

## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Activity Missing EVT" is designed to identify any activities in the DS04 Schedule table that are missing an Earned Value Technique (EVT).

The error is likely to be caused by the EVT field not being present for certain activities. This is problematic as each activity should have an associated EVT.

Please note that if a task is a milestone, its type should be either 'FM' (Finish Milestone) or 'SM' (Start Milestone). If the type is not one of these and is not an SVT or ZBA, it will be treated as an activity and thus should have an EVT.

The DIQ check is designed to ensure that all activities have an EVT, and that milestones are correctly classified. If the check identifies any activities without an EVT, or any milestones that are not correctly classified, these will need to be corrected in the DS04 Schedule table.

## Why do we check this?

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check for any activities that are missing an Earned Value Technique (EVT). The Earned Value Technique is a critical component in project management as it helps in measuring project performance and progress in an objective manner.

The severity of this test is marked as 'CRITICAL', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if an activity is found where the EVT is null or blank, it is a serious issue that must be fixed before the data can be reviewed or used for further analysis.

## Code

```sql

CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[fnDIQ_DS04_Sched_IsActivityMissingEVT] (
	@upload_id int = 0
)
RETURNS TABLE
AS RETURN
(
	SELECT
		*
	FROM
		DS04_schedule
	WHERE
			upload_id = @upload_ID
		AND type NOT IN ('SM','FM','WS')
		AND ISNULL(subtype,'') NOT IN ('SVT','ZBA')
		AND TRIM(ISNULL(EVT,'')) = ''
)
```
