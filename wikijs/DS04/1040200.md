# Started Task Missing Actual Start

## Basic Information
| Key         | Value          |
|-------------|----------------|
| Table       | DS04 Schedule |
| Severity    | MAJOR |
| Unique ID   | 1040200   |
| Summary     | Is this task with a non-zero % Complete missing an Actual Start? |
| Error message | Task with a non-zero % Complete (pc_units, pc_duration, or pc_physical > 0) missing Actual Start (AS_Date). |

## What causes this error?

The error from the Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check is likely being caused by entries in the DS04 Schedule table that have a non-zero "% Complete" but are missing an "Actual Start" date. 

When tracking progress on a task within the EVMS construction project, not having a 'Start Date' for a task that has been started (i.e., has non-zero "% Complete" values) leads to inconsistencies in the data, as tasks cannot have progress unless they have started.

The "% Complete" values are measured through three fields - 'pc_units', 'pc_duration', or 'pc_physical'. If any of these fields have a value that is greater than zero, it signifies progress on the task. However, the DIQ check is indicating that some of these tasks are missing a start date (Null value in 'AS_Date' field), suggesting a discrepancy in the dataset.

To resolve this issue, a date value that falls within the project timeline should be inputted for the 'AS_Date' field for any tasks that have non-zero "% Complete" values. The specific tasks causing the issue can be identified from the rows of data that fail the DIQ check, as returned by the function. Future data input should ensure an 'Actual Start' date is provided when there is progress recorded on the task.
## Why do we check this?

The “Started Task Missing Actual Start” test as defined in the DIQ test information provided is particularly critical for data quality and hence the success of the Energy Value Management System (EVMS) construction project. 

This test scrutinizes to check if any task that has been started (substantiated by a non-zero % Complete) is missing the crucial 'Actual Start' date information. As the Actual Start date marks the beginning of the task completion, lacking this data could potentially create inaccuracies or data discrepancies in the progress tracking, planning and scheduling of the project. 

Accuracy and integrity of data in the DS04 Schedule table is significant to the integrity of the whole EVMS as it enables performance measurement against the baseline, aids in resource and cost management, and risk assessment, as demonstrated in DOE Order 413.3B, which emphasizes on the implementation of comprehensive project management policy.

FAILURE to conduct this check could lead to major project issues, including unrealistic project timelines, inefficient resource allocation, potential cost overruns, reporting inaccuracies, and ultimately, failure to deliver the project on time and within budget. These risks can be mitigated by conducting this test and ensuring that the data's integrity and quality is maintained, facilitating an informed decision-making and more reliable project outcomes. 

In conclusion, conducting this check is in accordance with section 6.2.2 of DOE O 413.3B, which asserts the necessity for ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of project data and information systems.
## How can I fix this in my source data system

Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) test is designed to check if there are any tasks with non-zero % completion (pc_units, pc_duration, or pc_physical) but without an actual start date (AS_Date) in the DS04 Schedule data table. The test will return rows of data that fail the DIQ check.

Step-by-step instructions on how to fix the data in Oracle P6:

1. Open the PARS DIQ Reports and locate the diq test named "Started Task Missing Actual Start". This report will show a list of tasks that have passed this DIQ check. This report tells you which specific roles have failed the DIQ check.

2. Identify the tasks with missing AS_date (Actual start date) but have a non-zero completion percentage in the DS04 Schedule. These will be tasks with either the pc_duration, pc_units or pc_physical field greater than 0.

3. For each of the tasks located through the PARS DIQ test, you need to correct the data inconsistency. Open Oracle P6 and find the respective task.

4. Go to the "Progress" or "Tracking" section of each task located in Oracle P6. Here, you should be able to enter the actual start date for each of the tasks listed in the PARS DIQ report.

5. Make sure that any task that has a non-zero completion percentage also has an actual start date. The actual start date field cannot be blank for tasks that have begun (represented by % task completion above 0).

6. After updating the "Actual Start Date", save your changes in Oracle P6.

7. Run the "Started Task Missing Actual Start" DIQ test again, to validate the correction of the issues.

By following these steps for each task listed in the PARS DIQ Reports, you can ensure that your data in the Oracle P6 DS04 Schedule aligns with the requirements of the DIQ test. It's vital to remember that the DIQ test checks for a consistent relationship between the % completion field (represented by pc_ variables) of tasks and their actual start date (AS_Date). Therefore, any task recorded as having been started (non-zero % completion) should also have a corresponding actual start date to maintain accurate data integrity and quality.
