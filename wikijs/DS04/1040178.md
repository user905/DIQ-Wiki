## What causes this error?

> :robot: The following text was generated by an AI tool and hasn't been reviewed for accuracy by a human! It might be useful, but it also might have errors. Are you a human? You can help by reviewing it for accuracy! Edit it as needed then remove this message.

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Forecast Task Missing In Baseline" is designed to identify any tasks that are present in the forecast schedule but are missing from the baseline schedule in the DS04 Schedule table.

The error message "Task found in forecast schedule (schedule_type = FC) but not in baseline (schedule_type = BL)" indicates that there are tasks in the forecast schedule (where the schedule_type field is 'FC') that are not found in the baseline schedule (where the schedule_type field is 'BL').

This discrepancy could be due to a variety of reasons such as data entry errors, tasks being added or removed after the baseline schedule was established, or issues with data synchronization between the forecast and baseline schedules.

To maintain data integrity and quality, it is expected that all tasks in the forecast schedule should also be present in the baseline schedule. If this is not the case, the missing tasks should be identified and the necessary corrections should be made to ensure consistency between the forecast and baseline schedules.

This test is being performed to ensure that all tasks found in the forecast schedule are also present in the baseline schedule. The test is checking for any discrepancies between the two schedules, specifically tasks that are present in the forecast schedule but missing in the baseline schedule.

The importance of this check lies in maintaining consistency and accuracy in project management. The baseline schedule serves as the reference point for the project, outlining the planned tasks, timelines, and resources. The forecast schedule, on the other hand, is a dynamic tool that is updated regularly to reflect the current status and future predictions of the project. If a task is present in the forecast but missing in the baseline, it could indicate an oversight or error in planning, which could potentially lead to issues in project execution and tracking.

The severity of this check is marked as an MINOR. This means that while it's not a critical error that would prevent data review, it's still a potential issue that could cause minor problems or indicate that the data doesn't follow all best practices. It's a signal to review the schedules and ensure that all tasks are properly accounted for in both the baseline and forecast schedules.
