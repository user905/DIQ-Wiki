The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CD-2 Milestone Missing in Baseline" is designed to verify the presence of the CD-2 milestone in the baseline schedule of the DS04 Schedule table. 

The CD-2 milestone is a critical component of the project schedule, and its absence could indicate an incomplete or incorrect project plan. This milestone is identified by a milestone level of 130 in the DS04 Schedule table. 

The DIQ check is performed by counting the number of rows in the DS04 Schedule table where the schedule type is 'BL' (indicating a baseline schedule) and the milestone level is 130 (indicating a CD-2 milestone). If the count is zero, this means that the CD-2 milestone is missing from the baseline schedule.

If you encounter an error message stating "No row found for CD-2 milestone (milestone_level = 130) in baseline schedule (schedule_type = BL)", this indicates that the CD-2 milestone is not present in the baseline schedule. To resolve this issue, you should review your project plan and ensure that the CD-2 milestone is included in the baseline schedule.

This test is being performed to check if the baseline schedule in the DS04 Schedule table is missing the CD-2 milestone. The CD-2 milestone, also known as the "Approve Performance Baseline" milestone, is a critical point in the project lifecycle where the project's cost, scope, and schedule are formally approved. 

The severity of this test is marked as a MAJOR, which means that while the data can still be reviewed, the absence of this milestone is likely to cause problems during analysis. This is because the CD-2 milestone is a key indicator of project progress and its absence could lead to inaccurate project tracking and forecasting.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring that all necessary milestones are included in the baseline schedule. This helps in maintaining the integrity and quality of the project management data, allowing for accurate project planning, tracking, and control. Without this check, there could be significant gaps in the project timeline, leading to potential mismanagement and inefficiencies.
