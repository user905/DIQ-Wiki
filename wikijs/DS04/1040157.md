The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CD-3 Milestone Missing in Forecast" is designed to ensure that your forecast schedule, as recorded in the DS04 Schedule table, includes the CD-3 milestone. 

The CD-3 milestone is a critical component of the project management process, and its absence could indicate a significant oversight in project planning or data entry. This milestone is identified by a milestone level of 150 in the DS04 Schedule table.

If the DIQ check returns an error message stating "No row found for CD-3 milestone (milestone_level = 150) in forecast schedule (schedule_type = FC)", this means that the CD-3 milestone is missing from your forecast schedule. 

To resolve this issue, you should review your forecast schedule data and ensure that a row is included for the CD-3 milestone, with a milestone level of 150. If this row is missing, you will need to add it to your data. 

Please note that this DIQ check is designed to ensure the completeness and accuracy of your project management data, and is a critical tool for maintaining the integrity of your project schedules.

This test is being performed to ensure that the forecast schedule in the DS04 Schedule table includes the CD-3 milestone. The CD-3 milestone is a critical decision point in the project management process, marking the approval to start the construction phase. If this milestone is missing from the forecast schedule, it could lead to inaccurate project planning and forecasting.

The severity of this test is marked as a MAJOR. This means that while the absence of the CD-3 milestone in the forecast schedule may not immediately prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis. The project's timeline, resource allocation, and overall management could be negatively impacted if this issue is not addressed.

Therefore, this check is important to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the project's forecast schedule. It helps maintain the integrity of the project management data and supports effective decision-making and project execution.
