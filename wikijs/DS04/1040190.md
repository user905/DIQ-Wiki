Test Title: Late Start Later Than Late Finish (FC)

This Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check is performed on the DS04 Schedule table. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the Late Start (LS) date is not later than the Late Finish (LF) date in the Forecast Schedule (schedule_type = FC). 

If an error is flagged by this test, it indicates that there is a discrepancy in the scheduling data. Specifically, the issue lies in the LS_date and LF_date fields. In a correctly structured schedule, the Late Start date should always be earlier than or equal to the Late Finish date. If the Late Start date is later, it suggests an error in data entry or project scheduling.

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the LS_date and LF_date fields for the Forecast Schedule. Ensure that the Late Start date is not later than the Late Finish date. Correct any discrepancies to maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check if there are any instances where the late start date is later than the late finish date in the forecast schedule. The test is important because in project management, the late start date should not be later than the late finish date. If this occurs, it could indicate a problem with the scheduling or data entry, which could lead to issues in project planning and execution.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. It is crucial to address this issue to ensure accurate and reliable project management data.
