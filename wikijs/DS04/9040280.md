The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Reprogramming Missing in CC Log Detail (WP)" is designed to ensure that all Work or Planning (WP) entries in the DS04 Schedule table that are marked for reprogramming (RPG = 'Y') are also present in the DS10 CC Log Detail table. 

The DIQ check is performed by comparing the WBS_ID field in both tables. If a WBS_ID from the DS04 Schedule table with RPG marked as 'Y' is not found in the DS10 CC Log Detail table, an error is flagged. 

The likely cause of this error is that a WP entry marked for reprogramming in the DS04 Schedule table has not been properly logged in the DS10 CC Log Detail table. This could be due to a data entry error or a missing update in the DS10 table. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that all WP entries marked for reprogramming in the DS04 Schedule table are also present in the DS10 CC Log Detail table. The WBS_ID field should match in both tables for these entries.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check for the presence of reprogramming in the CC Log detail for Work or Planning Planning (WP). The test is looking for instances where the WBS_ID where RPG = Y is not found in the DS10.WBS_ID list. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that all reprogramming activities are properly logged and associated with the correct Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID. This is crucial for accurate tracking and management of project resources, costs, and schedules. 

The severity of this test is marked as a 'MAJOR', which means that if this issue is not addressed, it is likely to cause problems during data analysis. It may lead to inaccurate project cost and schedule estimations, which could potentially impact the overall project management and decision-making process. Therefore, it is important to rectify this issue to maintain the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data.
