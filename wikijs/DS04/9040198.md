## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WBS Justification Missing" is designed to ensure that all Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) entries in the DS04 Schedule table that are not of type 'WP', 'PP', or 'SLPP' have a justification provided. 

The error message "Non-WP/PP/SLPP type (DS01.type <> WP, PP, or SLPP) is missing a value in justification_WBS" indicates that there are entries in the DS04 Schedule table where the 'justification_WBS' field is empty for WBS types other than 'WP', 'PP', or 'SLPP'. 

This error is likely caused by incomplete data entry. For all WBS entries that are not of type 'WP', 'PP', or 'SLPP', a justification must be provided in the 'justification_WBS' field. If this field is left blank, the DIQ check will flag it as an error. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that a justification is provided for all non-'WP', 'PP', or 'SLPP' WBS entries in the DS04 Schedule table.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check if there are any Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) types that are not Work Package (WP), Planning Package (PP), or Summary Level Planning Package (SLPP) and are missing a justification. The Work Breakdown Structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The justification provides the reasoning or rationale behind the WBS type.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. This is because missing justifications for WBS types can lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the data, potentially leading to incorrect decisions or actions.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the data. It helps to maintain the integrity of the project management data by ensuring that all WBS types have a corresponding justification, thereby providing a clear understanding of the project structure and the reasoning behind it.
