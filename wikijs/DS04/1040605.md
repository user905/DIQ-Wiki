The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WBS Summary Task" is performed on the DS04 Schedule table. This check is designed to identify whether a task is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Summary task. 

The error is likely to be caused when the 'type' field in the DS04 Schedule table does not contain the expected value 'WS', which stands for WBS Summary. 

If the 'type' field contains any other value, it indicates that the task is not a WBS Summary task, which may lead to inconsistencies in the project management data. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that all WBS Summary tasks are correctly identified in the 'type' field with the value 'WS'. 

Please review the data in the 'type' field of the DS04 Schedule table to ensure it accurately reflects the nature of the tasks.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check if a particular task is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Summary task. The Work Breakdown Structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The WBS Summary task is a task that summarizes other tasks, providing a high-level overview of the project's progress.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MINOR', which means it is not a critical issue but could indicate minor problems or deviations from best practices. The test is checking if the task type is 'WS', which stands for WBS Summary. 

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the correct classification and organization of tasks within the project. Misclassification can lead to confusion, miscommunication, and potential errors in project management and execution. It also helps maintain the integrity of the project's structure and aids in efficient project tracking and management.
