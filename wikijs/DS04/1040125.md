## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Hard Constraint Found" is designed to identify any tasks in the DS04 Schedule table that have a hard constraint applied. Hard constraints are specific conditions that must be met for a task to be scheduled. They are identified by the following constraint types: 'CS_MANDSTART', 'CS_MSO', 'CS_MSOB', 'CS_MANDFIN', 'CS_MEO', or 'CS_MEOB'.

If this DIQ check returns a result, it means that one or more tasks in the DS04 Schedule table have a hard constraint applied. This could potentially cause scheduling issues, as hard constraints can limit the flexibility of the project schedule. 

To resolve this issue, review the tasks identified by the DIQ check and consider whether the hard constraints are necessary. If they are not, you may want to adjust the constraint type to a more flexible option. If the hard constraints are necessary, ensure that they are properly accounted for in your project scheduling.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check for the presence of hard constraints on tasks. Hard constraints in project management can restrict the start or finish dates of tasks, which can potentially cause scheduling issues. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. The presence of hard constraints can limit the flexibility of the project schedule and may lead to unrealistic or unachievable timelines.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring that the project schedule is realistic and manageable. It helps to identify potential scheduling issues early on, allowing for adjustments to be made before they become larger problems. This contributes to maintaining the integrity and quality of the project management data.
