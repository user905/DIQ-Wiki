The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Actual Start Earlier Than Early Start" is performed on the DS04 Schedule table. This check is designed to identify any tasks where the Actual Start date (AS_date) is earlier than the Early Start date (ES_date). 

This issue typically arises when there is an error in data entry or scheduling. The Actual Start date of a task should not precede its Early Start date, as this would imply that the task has begun before it was scheduled to start. 

The fields causing the issue are the AS_date and ES_date fields. The expected values for these fields should be such that the Actual Start date (AS_date) is on or after the Early Start date (ES_date). 

If this DIQ check identifies any tasks where the Actual Start date is earlier than the Early Start date, it is recommended to review the scheduling and data entry processes to ensure accuracy.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check if there are any tasks that have an 'Actual Start' date that is earlier than the 'Early Start' date. The purpose of this check is to ensure that the scheduling data is accurate and logical, as it is not typically expected for a task to actually start before its earliest planned start date.

The importance of this check lies in maintaining the integrity and reliability of the project schedule data. If tasks are starting earlier than planned, it could indicate issues with project planning, resource allocation, or data entry. It could also potentially lead to problems in project tracking and forecasting.

The severity of this check is classified as an 'MINOR', which means it is not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, but it is still a potential problem that should be addressed. It might cause minor problems during analysis or indicate that the data does not fully adhere to best practices. Therefore, any instances where the 'Actual Start' date is earlier than the 'Early Start' date should be investigated and corrected if necessary.
