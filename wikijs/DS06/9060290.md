The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Resource Budgets Misaligned with Cost" is designed to identify discrepancies between the resource budget dollars and the cost database (DB) in the DS06 Resources and DS03 Cost tables. This check is performed by comparing the sum of BCWSi_dollars in the DS03 Cost table with the budget_dollars in the DS06 Resources table for each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID and Estimate at Completion (EOC).

If the DIQ check identifies a discrepancy, it means that the resource budget dollars do not match the cost DB for a specific WBS ID and EOC. This could be due to an error in data entry, a miscalculation, or a misalignment between the budgeting and costing processes.

The fields causing the issue are the BCWSi_dollars field in the DS03 Cost table and the budget_dollars field in the DS06 Resources table. The expected values for these fields should be equal for each WBS ID and EOC. If they are not, it indicates a misalignment between the resource budget and the cost DB.

To resolve this issue, you should review the budgeting and costing processes for the affected WBS ID and EOC, and ensure that the resource budget dollars and cost DB are correctly calculated and aligned.

This test is being performed to ensure that the budgeted resources for the project align with the actual costs. In the context of the EVMS (Earned Value Management System), this is crucial for accurate project management and forecasting. The test is checking if the sum of the budgeted cost for work scheduled (BCWSi_dollars) in the DS03 table is not equal to the resource budget dollars for each Work Breakdown Structure ID (WBS_ID) and Estimate at Completion (EOC).

The importance of this check is to identify any discrepancies between the planned budget and the actual cost. If these values are misaligned, it could lead to inaccurate project cost projections, which could potentially impact the project's financial management and completion timeline.

The severity of this check is marked as an MINOR. This means that while it may not immediately halt data review or analysis, it could potentially cause minor problems or indicate that the data does not adhere to all best practices. It's a signal to review the data and correct any discrepancies to ensure accurate project management and financial forecasting.
