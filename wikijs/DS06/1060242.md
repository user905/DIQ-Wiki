The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Non-Zero Resource Lag Planned" is performed on the DS06 Resources table. This check is designed to identify any instances where a resource has been scheduled with a non-zero lag. 

The field under scrutiny in this check is 'lag_planned_days'. The expected value for this field is '0'. If the value is anything other than '0', it indicates that there is a planned lag for the resource, which may not be desirable in the project schedule. 

The error message "Resource planned lag (lag_planned_date) <> 0" is displayed when the check identifies a non-zero value in the 'lag_planned_days' field. This suggests that there is a discrepancy in the scheduling of resources, which could potentially lead to delays or inefficiencies in the project. 

To resolve this issue, review the resource scheduling in the DS06 Resources table and ensure that the 'lag_planned_days' field is set to '0' for all resources, indicating no planned lag.

This test is being performed on the 'DS06 Resources' table to check if any resources have been scheduled with a non-zero lag. The test is checking if the 'lag_planned_date' field is not equal to zero, which would indicate that there is a planned delay or lag in the utilization of the resource. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the project scheduling is accurate and realistic. If resources are planned with a lag, it could potentially delay the project timeline or cause inefficiencies in resource allocation. This could lead to increased costs or missed deadlines. 

The severity of this check is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it could cause problems during the analysis of the project management data. It is important to address this issue to ensure accurate project planning and resource management.
