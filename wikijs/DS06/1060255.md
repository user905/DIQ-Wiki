The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Resource Start Date Later Than Finish Date" is designed to ensure that the start date for a resource in the DS06 Resources table is not later than the finish date. 

If an error message "Resource start_date > finish_date" is received, it indicates that there is a data inconsistency where the start date of a resource is recorded as being later than the finish date. This is logically incorrect as a resource cannot start after it has finished.

The fields causing this issue are the 'start_date' and 'finish_date'. The expected values should be such that the 'start_date' is earlier than or equal to the 'finish_date'. 

To resolve this issue, review the data entries in the DS06 Resources table and correct any instances where the start date is later than the finish date. This will ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.

This test is being performed to ensure that the start date for a resource is not later than the finish date. This is important because it checks for logical inconsistencies in the data. In project management, a resource cannot finish before it starts, so this test is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the project timeline data.

The severity of this test is marked as a MAJOR. This means that while it may not immediately prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. For instance, it could lead to incorrect calculations of project duration or resource allocation, which could in turn affect project planning and decision-making. Therefore, it is important to address this issue to ensure accurate and reliable project management data.
