The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Resources with Negative Performance" is designed to identify any resources in the DS06 Resources table that have negative performance values. This check is important because negative performance values are not valid in the context of EVMS construction project management data.

The error message "Resource found with negative performance (actual_dollars < 0 and/or actual_units < 0)" indicates that there are resources with negative values in either the 'actual_dollars' field, the 'actual_units' field, or both. 

The 'actual_dollars' field should contain the actual cost of the resource in dollars, and the 'actual_units' field should contain the actual quantity of the resource used. Both of these fields should contain positive values, as it is not possible to have a negative cost or a negative quantity of a resource. 

If this error is encountered, it is likely due to incorrect data entry. The user should review the data in the 'actual_dollars' and 'actual_units' fields for the identified resources and correct any negative values.

This test is being performed on the 'DS06 Resources' table to identify any resources that have negative performance dollars and/or units. The purpose of this check is to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, as negative values in these fields could indicate data entry errors or other issues that could potentially distort the analysis and interpretation of the data.

The severity of this test is classified as a 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. Negative performance values could lead to incorrect calculations or misleading results, which could in turn affect decision-making and project management.

Therefore, this check is important as it helps to maintain the integrity and quality of the data by identifying potential issues that need to be addressed to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.
