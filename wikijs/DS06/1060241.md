The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Task with Overhead EOC Only" is designed to identify tasks in the DS06 Resources table that are resource-loaded with only Overhead EOC resources.

The DIQ check is looking for tasks where the EOC (Element of Cost) field is marked as 'Overhead' and there are no other types of EOC associated with the task. This could indicate a potential issue with the task's resource loading, as tasks typically should have more than just overhead costs associated with them.

If a task is flagged by this DIQ check, it means that the task has been identified as having only 'Overhead' in the EOC field and no other types of EOC. This could be due to an error in data entry or a misclassification of the task's resources.

To resolve this issue, you should review the flagged tasks and ensure that the resources associated with them are correctly classified. If a task should have other types of EOC associated with it, update the EOC field accordingly. If the task is indeed only associated with overhead costs, you may want to review the task's resource loading to ensure it is accurate and appropriate.

This test is being performed to check if there are any tasks in the 'DS06 Resources' table that are resource-loaded with only Overhead EOC resources. The severity of this test is marked as 'WARNING', which means that if this issue is not addressed, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis of the data.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the resource allocation in the tasks. If a task is only loaded with Overhead EOC resources, it might indicate that other necessary resources are missing. This could lead to inaccurate project cost estimations and could potentially impact the overall project management and execution. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and rectify such issues for maintaining the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data.
