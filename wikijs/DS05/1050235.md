The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check for the DS05 Schedule Logic table is designed to verify the integrity of the start-finish relationships in your project management data. This check is particularly important as it ensures that the relationship type is correctly identified as a start-finish (type = SF), which is crucial for accurate project scheduling and management.

If an error is flagged during this DIQ check, it is likely due to incorrect or inconsistent data entries in the 'type' field of the DS05 Schedule Logic table. The expected value for a start-finish relationship in this field is 'SF'. Any deviation from this value could trigger the error. 

To resolve this issue, review the 'type' field entries in the DS05 Schedule Logic table to ensure they are correctly marked as 'SF' for start-finish relationships. Correcting these entries will help maintain the integrity and quality of your project management data.

This test is being performed on the 'DS05 Schedule Logic' table to verify the type of relationship between tasks in the project schedule. Specifically, it is checking if the relationship type is 'start-finish' (SF), meaning one task must start before another can finish. 

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the correct sequencing and dependency of tasks in the project schedule. If tasks are not properly sequenced, it could lead to inaccurate project timelines, resource allocation issues, and potential project delays. 

The severity level is 'MAJOR', which implies that if this issue is not addressed, it could cause problems during the analysis of the project schedule. It may not prevent the data from being reviewed, but it could potentially lead to incorrect conclusions or decisions based on the data. Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue to maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.
