The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Task Missing in Schedule" is designed to verify the consistency of task data across the DS04 Schedule and DS05 Schedule Logic tables. 

This check is performed to ensure that every task listed in the DS05 Schedule Logic table is also present in the DS04 Schedule table. The check is performed separately for each schedule type, namely 'FC' and 'BL'. 

If a task is found in the DS05 Schedule Logic table that does not have a corresponding entry in the DS04 Schedule table for the same schedule type, this DIQ check will flag an error. The error message will indicate that the task_ID is not found in the DS04 task_ID list for the given schedule type.

The likely cause of this error is a discrepancy between the task lists in the DS04 Schedule and DS05 Schedule Logic tables. This could occur if a task is added or removed in one table but not the other, or if there is a typographical error in the task_ID field. 

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that all tasks are consistently listed across both tables and that the task_IDs are correctly entered. The expected values for the task_ID field are the unique identifiers of the tasks that are present in both the DS04 Schedule and DS05 Schedule Logic tables for each schedule type.

This test is being performed to ensure that all tasks are properly accounted for in the DS05 Schedule Logic table. The test is checking if a specific task, identified by its task_ID, is present in the DS04 task_ID list. If the task is not found, it means that there is a task missing in the schedule, which could lead to significant issues in project management, such as missed deadlines or resource allocation problems.

The severity of this check is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if this issue is not resolved, the data cannot be reviewed or used for further analysis. It is crucial to maintain data integrity and quality in project management data, as any discrepancies or missing information can lead to inaccurate project planning and execution. Therefore, this check is of utmost importance to ensure that all tasks are included in the schedule and no task is overlooked.

													 AND ISNULL(L.subproject_ID,'') = ISNULL(T.SubP,'')
	WHERE
			upload_id = @upload_ID
		AND T.task_ID IS NULL --missed joins means that a task is missing in DS04 for this piece of logic
)
