The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WP or PP Missing In FC Schedule" is designed to ensure that all Work Packages (WP) or Planning Packages (PP) listed in the DS03 Cost table are also present in the DS04 Schedule table, specifically where the schedule type is 'FC' (Final Cost).

The DIQ check is flagging an issue when a WP or PP, identified by the 'WBS_ID_WP' field in the DS03 Cost table, is not found in the list of 'WBS_ID' in the DS04 Schedule table. This discrepancy could be due to a data entry error, a missing entry in the DS04 Schedule table, or a mismatch between the WP or PP identifiers in the two tables.

The expected value for the 'WBS_ID_WP' field in the DS03 Cost table should match a 'WBS_ID' in the DS04 Schedule table. If this is not the case, the DIQ check will flag the issue for further investigation and resolution. 

Please ensure that all WP or PP identifiers in the DS03 Cost table are correctly entered and correspond to an entry in the DS04 Schedule table to maintain data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed to check if there are any Work Packages (WP) or Planning Packages (PP) that are missing in the Future Cost (FC) Schedule. The test is checking if there are any WBS_ID_WP (Work Breakdown Structure ID for Work Packages) that are missing from the DS04.WBS_ID list where the schedule type is FC. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that all the work packages and planning packages are properly accounted for in the future cost schedule. If any are missing, it could lead to inaccurate cost projections and potentially disrupt the project management process. 

The severity of this test is marked as a MAJOR. This means that while it may not immediately prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. It is crucial to address this issue to ensure accurate and reliable project cost management and forecasting.

	WHERE C.upload_ID = @upload_ID AND S.WBS_ID IS NULL
