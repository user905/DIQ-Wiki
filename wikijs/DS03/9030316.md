The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "SV without Root Cause Narrative (Favorable)" is designed to identify any instances in the DS03 Cost table where a root cause narrative is missing for a cost account (CA) where the Schedule Variance (SV) is exceeding the favorable dollar threshold. 

The SV is calculated as the absolute difference between the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) and the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS). If this value is greater than the favorable cumulative dollar threshold defined in the DS07 IPMR Header table, a root cause narrative should be provided in the DS11 Variance table. 

The DIQ check groups the results by the Cost Account Work Breakdown Structure ID (WBS_ID_CA) and identifies any instances where the narrative for the Schedule Variance (narrative_RC_SVc) in the DS11 Variance table is missing or blank. 

If the DIQ check identifies any instances where the SV exceeds the favorable dollar threshold and the root cause narrative is missing, this could indicate that the data entry for the root cause narrative was overlooked or not completed. It is important to ensure that all required fields are completed to maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.

This test is being performed to ensure that there is a root cause narrative for each Cost Account (CA) where the Schedule Variance (SV) is exceeding the favorable dollar threshold. The Schedule Variance is calculated as the difference between the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) and the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS). If this difference is greater than the favorable cumulative dollar threshold, a root cause narrative should be provided.

The importance of this check is to ensure that all significant variances in the project schedule are properly explained. This is crucial for understanding the reasons behind the variances and for making informed decisions about project management. The severity of this check is marked as a MAJOR, which means that missing or blank root cause narratives are likely to cause problems during the analysis of the project data. It is therefore recommended to address this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the project data.
