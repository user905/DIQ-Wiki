The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Labor Missing Estimates" is designed to identify any inconsistencies in the DS03 Cost table related to labor cost estimates. Specifically, it checks for entries where the End of Contract (EOC) is marked as 'Labor', but at least one of the following fields: Estimated To Complete (ETC) in dollars, ETC in Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs), or ETC in hours, is missing or equal to zero.

The error is likely to occur when there is an inconsistency in the data entry process. For instance, if labor costs have been estimated in terms of dollars, but not in terms of hours or FTEs, this would trigger the DIQ check. Similarly, if labor costs have been estimated in terms of hours or FTEs, but not in terms of dollars, this would also trigger the DIQ check.

To avoid this error, ensure that all labor cost estimates are consistently entered across all three fields: ETC in dollars, ETC in FTEs, and ETC in hours. If labor costs are being estimated, none of these fields should be left blank or set to zero.

This test, titled "Labor Missing Estimates," is being performed on the 'DS03 Cost' table to check for any instances where labor costs have been recorded, but there are missing estimates for either dollars, hours, or full-time equivalents (FTEs). The test is looking for any end-of-contract (EOC) labor costs where there is a non-zero estimate-to-complete (ETCi) for either dollars, hours, or FTEs, but where at least one other ETCi is zero.

The importance of this check is to ensure that all labor costs are properly estimated and accounted for. Missing estimates can lead to inaccurate cost projections and budgeting issues, which can impact the overall management and success of the EVMS construction project. 

The severity of this check is classified as an 'MINOR'. This means that while it may not immediately prevent data from being reviewed, it could potentially cause minor problems or indicate that the data does not adhere to all best practices. Therefore, it is recommended to address these issues to maintain high data integrity and quality.
## Code

```sql

RETURNS TABLE
AS RETURN
(
	SELECT 
		*

		DS03_Cost
	WHERE
			upload_ID = @upload_ID
		AND EOC = 'Labor'
		AND ISNULL(is_indirect,'') <> 'Y'
		AND (ETCi_dollars <> 0 OR ETCi_FTEs <> 0 OR ETCi_hours <> 0)

### Changelog

| Date       | Description of Changes   |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 2024-04-30 | Logic adjusted to account for 'is_indirect' field, which is used to exclude is_indirect = Y. All cases where is_indirect = 'Y' are treated as indirect data. |
