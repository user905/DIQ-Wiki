The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WP or PP Missing In BL Schedule" is designed to ensure that all Work Packages (WP) or Planning Packages (PP) listed in the DS03 Cost table are also present in the DS04 Schedule table.

The check is performed by comparing the 'WBS_ID_WP' field in the DS03 Cost table with the 'WBS_ID' field in the DS04 Schedule table. If a WP or PP from the DS03 Cost table is not found in the DS04 Schedule table, an error is flagged.

The error message "WBS_ID_WP missing from DS04.WBS_ID list (where schedule_type = BL)" indicates that there are one or more Work Packages or Planning Packages in the DS03 Cost table that are not found in the DS04 Schedule table where the schedule type is 'BL'.

This discrepancy could be due to a data entry error, a missing entry in the DS04 Schedule table, or a mismatch between the WP or PP identifiers in the two tables.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that all WP or PP identifiers in the DS03 Cost table match exactly with those in the DS04 Schedule table. Also, verify that all entries in the DS04 Schedule table have the correct schedule type 'BL'.

This test is being performed to check if there are any Work Packages (WP) or Planning Packages (PP) that are missing in the Baseline (BL) Schedule. The test is checking the 'DS03 Cost' table and is specifically looking for any instances where the 'WBS_ID_WP' is missing from the 'DS04.WBS_ID' list where the schedule type is 'BL'.

The importance of this check is to ensure that all work packages and planning packages are properly accounted for in the baseline schedule. If any are missing, it could lead to inaccuracies in project planning, costing, and scheduling. This could potentially lead to project delays, cost overruns, and other issues.

The severity of this check is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. Therefore, it is important to address this issue to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project management data.

	LEFT JOIN DS04_schedule S ON C.WBS_ID_WP = S.WBS_ID AND S.upload_ID = @upload_ID AND S.schedule_type = 'BL'
	WHERE C.upload_ID = @upload_ID AND S.WBS_ID IS NULL
