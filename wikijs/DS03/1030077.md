## Basic Information
| Key         | Value          |
|-------------|----------------|
| Table       | DS03 Cost |
| Severity    | CRITICAL |
| Unique ID   | 1030077   |
| Summary     | Is the WBS ID to which this work is apportioned missing? |
| Error message | EVT = J or M but EVT_J_to_WBS_ID is missing. |

## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Apportioned To WBS ID Missing" is designed to verify the presence of a WBS ID apportioned to when the EVT is either J (apportioned) or M (calculated apportionment). 

For EVT of J or M, the WBS ID apportioned to is a crucial piece of information that identifies the specific work package to which costs are apportioned. If this WBS ID apportioed to is missing, it can lead to inaccuracies in cost allocation and tracking, which can in turn affect the overall project management and financial reporting.

The error message "EVT = J or M but EVT_J_to_WBS_ID is missing" indicates that there are records in the DS03 Cost table where the EVT is either 'J' or 'M', but the corresponding WBS ID apportioned to (in field EVT_J_to_WBS_ID) is missing. This is likely due to incomplete data entry or a data import error.

To resolve this issue, ensure that every record in the DS03 Cost table with an EVT of 'J' or 'M' also includes a valid WBS ID in the EVT_J_to_WBS_ID field.
## Why do we check this?

This test is being performed to ensure that the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID apportioned to is identified, which is crucial for tracking and managing costs. The test checks if the Earned Value Technique (EVT) is either 'J' or 'M', but the field EVT_J_to_WBS_ID to which the work is apportioned is missing. 

The importance of this check lies in the fact that without the WBS ID apportioned to, it would be impossible to accurately track, manage, and apportion costs within the project. This could lead to mismanagement of resources, inaccurate cost reporting, and potential project overruns. 

The severity of this issue is marked as 'CRITICAL', which is the highest level of severity. This means that this issue must be fixed before the data can be reviewed or used for further analysis. If not addressed, it could lead to significant problems in project management and financial reporting.
