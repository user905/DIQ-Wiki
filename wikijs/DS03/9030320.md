The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "VAC without Root Cause Narrative (Favorable)" is designed to identify instances in the DS03 Cost table where a root cause narrative is missing for a cost account (CA) where the Variance at Completion (VAC) is exceeding the favorable dollar threshold. 

The VAC is calculated as the absolute difference between the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled in dollars (BCWSi_dollars), the Actual Cost of Work Performed in dollars (ACWPi_dollars), and the Estimate to Complete in dollars (ETCi_dollars). This value is then compared to the favorable dollar threshold set in the DS07 IPMR Header table (threshold_cost_VAC_dollar_fav).

The error is likely to occur when the calculated VAC for a CA in the DS03 Cost table is greater than the favorable dollar threshold, and there is no corresponding narrative in the DS11 Variance table (narrative_overall) for that CA (WBS_ID_CA) with a narrative type of 120. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that for each CA in the DS03 Cost table where the VAC exceeds the favorable dollar threshold, there is a corresponding narrative in the DS11 Variance table with a narrative type of 120.

This test is being performed to ensure that there is a root cause narrative for any cost account (CA) where the Variance at Completion (VAC) is exceeding the favorable dollar threshold. The Variance at Completion (VAC) is a measure of the cost performance of the project, and it is calculated as the difference between the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS), the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP), and the Estimate to Complete (ETC). 

The test checks if the absolute value of this difference is greater than the favorable dollar threshold set in the DS07 table, and if so, it checks if there is a corresponding narrative in the DS11 table. If the narrative is missing or blank, the test raises a warning.

The importance of this check is to ensure that there are explanations for any significant variances in the project's cost performance. This is crucial for understanding the reasons behind the variances and for making informed decisions about the project's future. The severity of this check is set to MAJOR, which means that while the absence of a narrative might not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis of the project's cost performance.
