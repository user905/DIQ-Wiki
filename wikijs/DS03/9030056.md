The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Cost Estimates After PMB End" is designed to identify any estimated work that is scheduled after the end of the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB). This check is performed on the DS03 Cost table.

The error is likely to occur when the period date of the last recorded estimate to complete (ETCi) in dollars, hours, or FTEs is greater than the end schedule (ES) date for the milestone level 175 in the DS04 Schedule table. 

In simpler terms, this means that there are cost estimates for work that is planned to occur after the project's baseline schedule has ended. This could be due to a data entry error or a misalignment between the project's cost and schedule data.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that all estimated work is scheduled within the PMB. This means that the period date for all ETCi entries in the DS03 Cost table should not exceed the ES date for milestone level 175 in the DS04 Schedule table.

This test is being performed to check if there are any cost estimates that extend beyond the end of the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB). The PMB is a time-phased budget plan against which performance can be measured. If there are cost estimates after the PMB end, it could indicate that there are tasks or activities that have not been properly accounted for within the project's baseline.

The importance of this check is to ensure that all project costs are accurately captured within the project's timeline. If costs are estimated beyond the PMB end, it could lead to budget overruns or mismanagement of resources. This could potentially impact the project's success and the ability to deliver on time and within budget.

The severity of this check is an MINOR, which means it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed. However, it's still important to address as it could lead to minor problems or indicate that the data doesn't follow all best practices. It's recommended to review these cost estimates and adjust the project's baseline if necessary.
