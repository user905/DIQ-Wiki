## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CC Found Without CC Description" is designed to identify any instances in the DS03 Cost table where a Cost Code (CC) is present but lacks an accompanying description. 

The error message "CC ID found without an accompanying CC description" indicates that there are records in the DS03 Cost table where the CC_ID field is populated, but the CC_description field is empty. 

This issue is likely caused by incomplete data entry or a data import error. The expected values for the CC_description field would be a text description corresponding to the Cost Code in the CC_ID field. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that each Cost Code in the CC_ID field has a corresponding description in the CC_description field. This will improve the overall data integrity and quality in the DS03 Cost table.

This test is being performed to check for instances where a Cost Code (CC) is found without an accompanying description in the 'DS03 Cost' table. The purpose of this check is to ensure that all cost codes have a corresponding description, which is crucial for understanding and interpreting the cost data accurately. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'MINOR', which means it is not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed. However, it does indicate that there might be minor problems or that the data doesn't follow all best practices. If a cost code is found without a description, it could potentially cause confusion or misinterpretation during data analysis, as the meaning or purpose of the cost code may not be clear. Therefore, while it's not a critical error, it's still important to address this issue to maintain the integrity and quality of the data.
