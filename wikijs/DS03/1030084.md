The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Negative Estimates" is designed to identify any Control Accounts (CA), Work Packages (WP), or Planning Packages (PP) in the DS03 Cost table that have negative estimates. 

The check specifically looks at three fields: ETCi_dollars, ETCi_FTEs, and ETCi_hours. If any of these fields contain a value less than zero, the DIQ check will flag it as an error. 

Negative estimates are typically indicative of an error in data entry or calculation. Estimates should always be positive values, as they represent a projection of future costs or resources needed. If you encounter this error, you should review the data for the flagged CA, WP, or PP to ensure that the estimates have been entered correctly.

This test is being performed on the 'DS03 Cost' table to check for any Control Account (CA), Work Package (WP), or Planning Package (PP) that have negative estimates. The test is looking for instances where the Estimate to Complete (ETCi) is less than zero, which could be in terms of dollars, hours, or Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs). 

The importance of this check is to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project's cost data. Negative estimates could indicate data entry errors, calculation errors, or unrealistic cost projections, all of which could lead to inaccurate project cost forecasting and budgeting. 

The severity of this check is marked as a 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. It is crucial to address these issues to ensure the integrity of the project's cost data and to facilitate accurate and effective project management decisions.
