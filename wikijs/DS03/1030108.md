The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Non-Unique Cost Row" is designed to identify any potential duplicate entries in the DS03 Cost table. This check is important to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table.

The check operates by examining the combination of the following fields: period date, CA WBS ID, WP WBS ID, EOC, and EVT. If the same combination of these fields appears more than once in the table, it is flagged as a potential duplicate entry.

The likely cause of this error is the entry of identical data in multiple rows. This could be due to a data entry error, or it could indicate a problem with the data source or import process.

To resolve this issue, each row in the DS03 Cost table should have a unique combination of period date, CA WBS ID, WP WBS ID, EOC, and EVT. If duplicates are found, they should be investigated and corrected to ensure the integrity and quality of the data.

This test is being performed to ensure that there are no duplicate entries in the 'DS03 Cost' table for the combination of period date, CA WBS ID, WP WBS ID, EOC, and EVT. Duplicate entries can lead to incorrect calculations and misinterpretation of data, which can negatively impact the decision-making process in the EVMS construction project management.

The severity of this test is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if any duplicate entries are found, they must be corrected before the data can be further reviewed or analyzed. This is crucial because maintaining data integrity and quality is paramount in ensuring accurate and reliable project management. Any discrepancies in the data can lead to significant errors in project planning, execution, and evaluation.
