The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Incremental SV without Root Cause Narrative (Unfavorable)" is designed to ensure that a root cause narrative is provided whenever the incremental Schedule Variance (SVi) exceeds the unfavorable dollar threshold. This check is performed on the DS03 Cost table.

The SVi is calculated as the absolute difference between the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWPi) and the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWSi) for each Control Account (CA). The unfavorable dollar threshold is retrieved from the DS07 IPMR Header table.

The DIQ check identifies any CAs where the SVi exceeds the unfavorable dollar threshold and where a root cause narrative for the SVi is missing or blank in the DS11 Variance table. The check groups the results by the Control Account Work Breakdown Structure ID (WBS_ID_CA).

If this DIQ check fails, it is likely because a root cause narrative has not been provided for a CA where the SVi has exceeded the unfavorable dollar threshold. To resolve this issue, a root cause narrative should be provided in the DS11 Variance table for each CA where the SVi exceeds the unfavorable dollar threshold.

This test is being performed to ensure that there is a root cause narrative for any cost account (CA) where the incremental Schedule Variance (SV) exceeds the unfavorable dollar threshold. The Schedule Variance is calculated by subtracting the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) from the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP). If the absolute value of this difference is greater than the unfavorable dollar threshold, a root cause narrative should be provided.

The importance of this check is to ensure that any significant deviations from the planned schedule are properly documented and explained. This is crucial for understanding why the project is not proceeding as planned and for making necessary adjustments. The severity level is set to MAJOR, which means that missing or blank root cause narratives are likely to cause problems during the analysis of the data. This is because without these narratives, it would be difficult to understand the reasons behind the observed schedule variances.
