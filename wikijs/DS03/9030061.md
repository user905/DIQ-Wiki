## Basic Information
| Key         | Value          |
|-------------|----------------|
| Table       | DS03 Cost |
| Severity    | CRITICAL |
| Unique ID   | 9030061   |
| Summary     | Has this SLPP, CA, or PP collected performance? |
| Error message | SLPP, CA, or PP found with BCWPi <> 0 (Dollars, Hours, or FTEs). |

## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Performance On SLPP, CA, or PP" is designed to verify whether a SLPP, CA, or PP in the DS03 Cost table has collected performance. This check is important to ensure that the data in the DS03 Cost table is accurate and reliable.

The error message "SLPP, CA, or PP found with BCWPi <> 0 (Dollars, Hours, or FTEs)" indicates that there are records in the DS03 Cost table where the BCWPi (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed Incremental) in dollars, hours, or FTEs (Full-Time Equivalents) is not equal to zero. This is unexpected because the BCWPi should be zero for SLPP, CA, or PP.

The fields causing this issue are BCWPi_dollars, BCWPi_FTEs, and BCWPi_hours. The expected values for these fields should be zero whenon the SLPP, CA, or PP. 

Additionally, the check also considers the WBS_ID_WP (Work Breakdown Structure ID Work Package) and EVT (Earned Value Technique) fields. If the WBS_ID_WP field is empty or the EVT field is 'K', it suggests that the record is not associated with a work package that has collected performance, and therefore, the BCWPi should be zero. Performance (BCWP) is only to be collected on WPs.

In summary, this DIQ check is crucial to ensure that the BCWPi values in the DS03 Cost table reflect that no performance is collected on SLPP, CA, or PP. Any discrepancies detected by this check should be investigated and corrected to maintain the integrity and quality of the data.
## Why do we check this?

This test is being performed on the DS03 Cost table to check if there has been any performance collected on a SLPP, CA, or PP. The test is looking for instances where the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed incremental (BCWPi) is not equal to zero on any SLPP, CA, or PP, which would indicate that some performance has been collected. The importance of this check is to ensure that the data integrity is maintained and that the performance data being reported is accurate. 

The severity of this check is marked as 'CRITICAL', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if this issue is not addressed, the data cannot be reviewed or used for further analysis. It is crucial to fix this error to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project management data.
