## Basic Information
| Key         | Value          |
|-------------|----------------|
| Table       | DS01 WBS |
| Severity    | MAJOR |
| Unique ID   | 1010014   |
| Summary     | Does the CA have a different CAM from its descendants? |
| Error message | CA and its descendents do not share the same CAM. |

## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CAM Not Consistent in CA Branch" is designed to ensure that the Control Account Manager (CAM) assigned to a Control Account (CA) is consistent across all its descendant Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) elements in the DS01 WBS table. 

An error message "CA and its descendants do not share the same CAM" indicates that there is a discrepancy between the CAM assigned to a CA and the CAM assigned to one or more of its descendant WBS elements (WPs or PPs). The expectation is a consistent CAM assignment across a CA and all its descendant WBS elements. An inconsistency could be due to a data entry error or a change in CAM assignment that was not properly updated across all related WBS elements.

To resolve this issue, review the CAM assignments for the identified CA and its descendants in the DS01 WBS table and correct any inconsistencies.
## Why do we check this?

This test is being performed to ensure that the Control Account (CA) and its descendants have the same Control Account Manager (CAM). In the context of EVMS (Earned Value Management System), a CAM is responsible for planning, organizing, and controlling all aspects of a control account. If the CA and its descendants do not share the same CAM, it could lead to inconsistencies in project management, such as miscommunication or misalignment in project goals and objectives.

The severity of this test is marked as a MAJOR, which implies that this issue is likely to cause problems during data analysis. It is crucial to address this issue to ensure accurate and consistent project management data. If not addressed, it could lead to inaccurate project tracking, budgeting, and forecasting, which could ultimately impact the overall success of the construction project.
