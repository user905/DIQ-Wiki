## Basic Information
| Key         | Value          |

| Table       | DS01 WBS |
| Severity    | MAJOR |
| Unique ID   | 1010011   |
| Summary     | Does the WP or PP have a child in the WBS hierarchy? |
| Error message | WP or PP found with child in the WBS hierarchy. |

## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WP or PP with Child" is designed to verify the hierarchical structure of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in the DS01 WBS table. Specifically, it checks whether any Work Packages (WP) or Planning Packages (PP) have child elements in the WBS hierarchy.

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that there are WP or PP entries in the DS01 WBS table that have been incorrectly assigned child elements. In a proper WBS hierarchy, WP and PP entries should not have child elements. 

To resolve this issue, review the WBS hierarchy and ensure that WP and PP entries are not assigned any child elements.
## Why do we check this?

This test is being performed to check the hierarchical structure of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in the DS01 WBS table. Specifically, it is checking whether a Work Package (WP) or Planning Package (PP) has a child in the WBS hierarchy. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the WBS hierarchy is correctly structured. In project management, a WP or PP should typically be at the lowest level of the WBS and should not have any child elements. If a WP or PP is found with a child in the WBS hierarchy, it could indicate a problem with the way the WBS has been structured, which could lead to issues in project planning and execution.

The severity of this check is marked as a MAJOR. This means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. It is therefore recommended that this issue be addressed to ensure accurate project management and reporting.
