The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WBS ID with Adjacent Letters" is designed to verify the structure of the WBS ID in the DS01 WBS table. The WBS ID should not contain letters adjacent to one another. 

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that there are entries in the WBS ID field that contain two or more letters side by side. This is not the expected format for the WBS ID. The WBS ID should typically be a combination of numbers and letters, but the letters should not be adjacent to each other. 

To resolve this issue, review the WBS ID entries in the DS01 WBS table and correct any instances where letters are adjacent to one another. This will ensure the integrity and quality of the WBS ID data.

This test is being performed to check the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID in the DS01 WBS table for any instances where letters are adjacent to one another. The Work Breakdown Structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The unique identifier (ID) for each section should follow a specific format for consistency and ease of reference.

The severity of this test is marked as an MINOR, which means it's not a critical error but it could potentially cause minor problems or indicate that the data doesn't adhere to all best practices. The importance of this check lies in maintaining the standardization and consistency of the WBS IDs. If letters are adjacent to one another in the WBS ID, it could potentially lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the data, especially in large projects with numerous WBS elements. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the WBS ID follows the correct format.
