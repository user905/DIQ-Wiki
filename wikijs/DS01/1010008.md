## What causes this error?

> :robot: The following text was generated by an AI tool and hasn't been reviewed for accuracy by a human! It might be useful, but it also might have errors. Are you a human? You can help by reviewing it for accuracy! Edit it as needed then remove this message.

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check with ID '6' is designed to ensure that the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID is not included in the title of the WBS. This check is performed on the DS01 WBS table.

The WBS ID is a unique identifier for each WBS, while the title should provide a brief description of the WBS. Including the WBS ID in the title can lead to confusion and redundancy. Therefore, the title field should not contain the WBS ID.

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that one or more records in the DS01 WBS table have a title that includes the WBS ID. To resolve this issue, review the titles in the DS01 WBS table and remove any instances of the WBS ID from the title field. The title should only contain a brief, descriptive text about the WBS.

This test is being performed to check if the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID is contained in the title of the 'DS01 WBS' table. The purpose of this check is to ensure that the title of the WBS is descriptive and informative, rather than just being a repetition of the WBS ID. 

The severity of this test is marked as an MINOR, which means it is not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed. However, it is still important to address this issue as it could potentially cause minor problems in understanding and interpreting the data. It also indicates that the data does not fully adhere to best practices for data management. 

In terms of data integrity and quality, this check is important because it helps maintain consistency and clarity in the data. It ensures that each piece of data in the WBS table is unique and easily identifiable, which can greatly facilitate data analysis and project management.
