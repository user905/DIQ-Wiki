## Basic Information
| Key         | Value          |
|-------------|----------------|
| Table       | DS01 WBS |
| Severity    | CRITICAL |
| Unique ID   | 1010016   |
| Summary     | Is this CA or SLPP at a lower level in the WBS hierarchy than a WP in the same branch? |
| Error message | CA or SLPP found at a lower level in the WBS hierarchy than a WP in the same branch. |

## What causes this error?


The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CA or SLPP with WP Ancestor" is designed to ensure the correct hierarchical structure in the DS01 WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) table. This check is specifically looking for instances where a Control Account (CA) or a Summary Level Planning Package (SLPP) is found at a lower level in the WBS hierarchy than a Work Package (WP) within the same branch.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the 'type' field correctly identifies the type of work package, and that the hierarchical relationships between work packages are accurately represented in the WBS hierarchy. A CA or SLPP should not be found at a lower level than a WP in the same branch of the WBS.
## Why do we check this?

This test is being performed to ensure that the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) hierarchy is correctly maintained in the DS01 WBS table. Specifically, it checks if a Control Account (CA) or Summary Level Planning Package (SLPP) is found at a lower level in the WBS hierarchy than a Work Package (WP) in the same branch. This is not a correct setup as per the standard project management practices.

The severity of this test is marked as 'CRITICAL', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if this issue is found, it must be fixed before the data can be reviewed further. This is because an incorrect WBS hierarchy can lead to significant problems in project management, such as incorrect allocation of resources, inaccurate project tracking, and potential project delays. 

## Code

```sql

CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[fnDIQ_DS01_WBS_IsCAorSLPPAtLowerLevelThanWP] (
	@upload_id int = 0
)
RETURNS TABLE
AS RETURN
(
	
	SELECT 
		* 
	FROM 
		DS01_WBS 
	WHERE 
		upload_ID = @upload_ID
	AND	WBS_ID IN (
			SELECT WBS_ID 
			FROM AncestryTree_Get(@upload_ID) A 
			WHERE type IN ('SLPP','CA') AND Ancestor_Type = 'WP'
		)
)
