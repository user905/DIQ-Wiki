The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "External WBS Without Subproject ID" is designed to identify any instances in the DS01 WBS table where an external Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is missing a subproject ID.

The WBS is a key component of project management, providing a hierarchical framework for organizing and managing the work required to complete a project. In the context of the DS01 WBS table, each WBS is expected to be associated with a specific subproject, identified by a unique subproject ID.

This DIQ check is triggered when a WBS is marked as 'external' (i.e., the 'external' field is set to 'Y'), but the 'subproject_ID' field is either missing or blank. This could be due to a data entry error, or a problem with the process used to import or generate the data.

To resolve this issue, ensure that each external WBS in the DS01 WBS table is associated with a valid subproject ID. If a subproject ID is missing or blank, it should be added or corrected as necessary.

This test is being performed to ensure that all external Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) in the DS01 WBS table have a corresponding subproject ID. The Work Breakdown Structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The subproject ID is a unique identifier for each subproject within the overall project.

The test is checking for instances where the WBS is marked as external (External = Y) but the subproject_ID field is missing or blank. This is important because without a subproject ID, it can be difficult to track and manage the specific tasks, resources, and costs associated with that part of the project.

The severity of this check is marked as a WARNING. This means that while the data can still be reviewed, the absence of subproject IDs for external WBS could cause problems during analysis. It could lead to confusion, misallocation of resources, or inaccuracies in project tracking and reporting. Therefore, it is recommended to address this issue to ensure data integrity and quality.
