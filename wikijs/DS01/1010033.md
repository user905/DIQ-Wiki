| Table       | DS01 WBS |
| Severity    | CRITICAL |

| Summary     | Is the top element of your WBS hierarchy of a type other than WBS? |
| Error message | Level 1 WBS element not of type WBS. |

## What causes this error?


This DIQ check is designed to ensure that the root of your Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) hierarchy is of the correct type, specifically 'WBS'. This check is performed on the data in the DS01 WBS table.

## Why do we check this?

This test is being performed to ensure that the top element of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) hierarchy is of the type 'WBS'. The Work Breakdown Structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The top element of the WBS hierarchy should be of the type 'WBS' to ensure that the structure is correctly organized and that all subsequent elements fall under the correct hierarchy.

The severity of this test is marked as 'CRITICAL', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if the top element of the WBS hierarchy is not of the type 'WBS', it is a critical issue that must be fixed before the data can be reviewed.

	SELECT

	FROM 
		DS01_WBS 
	WHERE 
			upload_ID = @upload_ID
