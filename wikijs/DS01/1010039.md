## Basic Information
| Key         | Value          |
|-------------|----------------|
| Table       | DS01 WBS |
| Severity    | CRITICAL |
| Unique ID   | 1010039   |
| Summary     | Is the Parent WBS ID missing in the WBS ID list? |
| Error message | Parent WBS ID not found in the WBS ID list. |

## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Parent WBS ID Missing In WBS List" is designed to ensure that every Parent Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID listed in the DS01 WBS table is also present in the WBS ID list of the same table. 

The error message "Parent WBS ID not found in the WBS ID list" indicates that there are instances where a Parent WBS ID does not have a corresponding entry in the WBS ID list. This discrepancy can cause issues in the project management data, as it disrupts the hierarchical structure of the WBS, which is crucial for effective project planning and control.

To resolve this issue, ensure that every Parent WBS ID listed in the DS01 WBS table has a matching entry in the WBS ID list. This will maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.
## Why do we check this?

This test is being performed to ensure that every Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID has a corresponding Parent WBS ID in the WBS ID list. The Work Breakdown Structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections.

The severity of this test is marked as 'CRITICAL', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if a Parent WBS ID is missing, it is a critical issue that must be fixed before the data can be reviewed. This is because without the Parent WBS ID, the hierarchical structure of the project tasks would be disrupted, leading to potential mismanagement and confusion in project execution.

## Code

```sql

CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[fnDIQ_DS01_WBS_IsParentWBSIDMissingFromWBSIDList] (
	@upload_id int = 0
)
RETURNS TABLE
AS RETURN
(
    -- Insert statements for procedure here
	SELECT 
		* 
	FROM 
		DS01_WBS
	WHERE 
			upload_ID = @upload_ID
    AND [external] = 'N'
		AND parent_WBS_ID NOT IN (SELECT WBS_ID FROM DS01_WBS WHERE upload_ID=@upload_ID)
)
