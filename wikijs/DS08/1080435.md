The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "POP Start On or After POP Finish" is designed to ensure that the start date of the Period of Performance (POP) is not on or after the finish date. This check is performed on the DS08 WAD table.

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it indicates that there are records in the DS08 WAD table where the 'pop_start_date' is either the same as or later than the 'pop_finish_date'. This is not expected as the start date of a period should always be earlier than the finish date.

To resolve this issue, review the 'pop_start_date' and 'pop_finish_date' fields in the DS08 WAD table. Ensure that the 'pop_start_date' is earlier than the 'pop_finish_date' for all records. If any discrepancies are found, correct the dates accordingly to maintain the integrity and quality of the data.

This test is being performed to ensure that the Period of Performance (POP) start date is not on or after the POP finish date in the DS08 WAD table. The importance of this check is to maintain the logical consistency of the data, as it is not possible for a project's start date to be on or after its finish date. The severity of this test is marked as an MINOR, which means it is not a critical error but could indicate minor problems or deviations from best practices. If not addressed, it could potentially lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the data during analysis.
