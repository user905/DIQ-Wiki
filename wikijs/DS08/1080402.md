The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Labor Dollars without Labor Hours" is designed to identify any inconsistencies in the DS08 Work Authorization Directive (WAD) data. Specifically, it checks for instances where labor costs (budget_labor_dollars) are recorded, but no corresponding labor hours (budget_labor_hours) are logged.

The error message "budget_labor_dollars > 0 & budget_labor_hours = 0" indicates that there are labor costs associated with a project, but no labor hours have been recorded. This could be due to a data entry error, where labor hours were inadvertently left blank or set to zero, despite labor costs being incurred.

The expected values for these fields would be that if there are labor dollars recorded (budget_labor_dollars > 0), there should also be labor hours recorded (budget_labor_hours > 0). If labor hours are not recorded, it could lead to inaccurate project cost estimations and tracking. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that both labor dollars and hours are accurately recorded in the DS08 WAD data.

This test is being performed to check for inconsistencies in the 'DS08 WAD' table where there are labor dollars recorded but no corresponding labor hours. This could indicate a data entry error or a problem with the data collection process. The importance of this check is to ensure that the labor costs and hours are accurately represented in the data. This is crucial for accurate project management and budgeting. The severity of this test is marked as an 'MINOR', which means it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, but it's still important to address as it could cause minor problems in the data analysis or indicate that the data doesn't fully adhere to best practices.
