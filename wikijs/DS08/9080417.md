The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WP Material Dollars Missing In Cost" is designed to identify any discrepancies in the DS08 WAD table where the budgeted material dollars for a work package (WP) or planning package (PP) are not reflected in the DS03 cost table. 

This issue arises when the 'budget_material_dollars' field in the DS08 WAD table has a value greater than zero, indicating that a budget has been allocated for materials, but the corresponding 'BCWSi_dollars' field in the DS03 cost table is zero. This discrepancy suggests that the budgeted material costs are not being accounted for in the overall cost of the work package or planning package.

The DIQ check specifically looks for instances where the 'EOC' (Element of Cost) field is marked as 'Material' in the DS03 cost table, but the 'BCWSi_dollars' field is zero. This indicates that although materials are a component of the cost, they are not being included in the budgeted cost.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the 'BCWSi_dollars' field in the DS03 cost table accurately reflects the budgeted material costs as indicated in the 'budget_material_dollars' field in the DS08 WAD table.

This test is being performed to ensure that the material budget dollars for a particular work package or planning package (WP/PP) are not missing in the cost. The test checks if the budgeted cost for work scheduled (BCWSi) in dollars is zero while the budget for material dollars is greater than zero. This could indicate a discrepancy or error in the data, as it would be unusual to have a material budget but no scheduled cost for that material.

The importance of this check is to maintain the accuracy and completeness of the project's financial data. If material costs are not accurately reflected in the overall budget, it could lead to incorrect financial reporting and potentially impact the project's financial management. This could cause problems during analysis, hence the severity is marked as a MAJOR. It's crucial to address this issue to ensure the integrity of the project's financial data and to facilitate accurate project management and decision-making.
