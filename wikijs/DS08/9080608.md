The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CA WBS ID Missing in WBS Dictionary" is designed to verify the presence of each Control Account (CA) Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID in the WBS dictionary. This check is performed on the DS08 WAD table.

The error message "WBS_ID not in DS01.WBS_ID list" indicates that there is a WBS ID in the DS08 WAD table that is not found in the DS01 WBS dictionary. This discrepancy could be due to a missing entry in the DS01 WBS dictionary or a typographical error in the WBS ID in the DS08 WAD table.

The expected value for the WBS ID in the DS08 WAD table should match an existing WBS ID in the DS01 WBS dictionary. If the DIQ check fails, it is recommended to cross-verify the WBS IDs in both tables and correct any discrepancies to ensure data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed to check if the Control Account (CA) Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID is missing in the WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary is a crucial component of project management that provides detailed information about each element in the WBS, including the WBS ID. If a CA WBS ID is missing, it could lead to confusion, miscommunication, or errors in project management and data analysis.

The severity of this test is marked as a MAJOR. This means that while the issue does not make the data unreviewable, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. It is important to address this issue to ensure accurate and efficient project management and data analysis. The WBS ID is a key identifier used in tracking and managing tasks in a project, so any discrepancies in its recording can lead to significant issues in project execution and monitoring.
