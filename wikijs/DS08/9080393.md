The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WP ODC Dollars Misaligned With Cost" is designed to ensure that the Other Direct Costs (ODC) budget dollars for each Work Package (WP) or Planning Package (PP) in the DS08 Work Authorization Document (WAD) table align with the corresponding costs in the DS03 Cost table.

The DIQ check compares the 'budget_ODC_dollars' field in the DS08 WAD table with the sum of 'BCWSi_dollars' in the DS03 Cost table for each WP or PP where the Element of Cost (EOC) is 'ODC'. The check identifies any instances where these values do not match.

If the DIQ check identifies a misalignment, it is likely due to an error in data entry or a discrepancy between the budgeted and actual costs. The fields causing the issue are 'budget_ODC_dollars' in the DS08 WAD table and 'BCWSi_dollars' in the DS03 Cost table. The expected values for these fields should be equal for each WP or PP where the EOC is 'ODC'. 

To resolve the issue, review the budgeted and actual costs for each WP or PP where a discrepancy has been identified. Ensure that the 'budget_ODC_dollars' in the DS08 WAD table accurately reflects the sum of 'BCWSi_dollars' in the DS03 Cost table for each WP or PP where the EOC is 'ODC'.

This test is being performed to ensure that the Other Direct Costs (ODC) budget dollars for a particular Work Package/Planning Package (WP/PP) Work Authorization Document (WAD) align with the costs recorded in the system. The test is comparing the budgeted ODC dollars with the sum of the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) dollars for the same WP/PP where the Element of Cost (EOC) is ODC.

The importance of this check is to ensure that the budgeted and actual costs are in alignment. If they are not, it could indicate errors in budgeting, cost recording, or financial management, which could lead to inaccurate financial reporting and decision-making. The severity level is a MAJOR, which means that if this issue is not addressed, it could cause problems during the analysis of the project's financial data. It is crucial to maintain data integrity and quality in project management to ensure accurate and reliable financial management and reporting.
