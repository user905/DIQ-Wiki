The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "POP Finish After Project Planned Completion Milestone" is designed to ensure that the Period of Performance (POP) finish date is not later than the planned completion milestone. This check is performed on the DS08 WAD table.

The error message "pop_finish > DS04.ES_date/EF_date where milestone_level = 170 & schedule_type = BL" indicates that the POP finish date is later than either the Early Start (ES) date or the Early Finish (EF) date in the DS04 Schedule table, where the milestone level is 170 and the schedule type is 'BL'. 

The fields causing the issue are the POP_finish_date in the DS08 WAD table and the ES_date and EF_date in the DS04 Schedule table. The expected values should be such that the POP finish date is not later than either the ES date or the EF date when the milestone level is 170 and the schedule type is 'BL'. 

If this error occurs, it suggests that there may be a discrepancy in the project schedule, with tasks planned to finish after the project's planned completion milestone. This could be due to data entry errors or issues with project planning. It is recommended to review and correct the project schedule as necessary to ensure data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed to check if the Period of Performance (POP) finish date is later than the planned completion milestone for the project. The test is comparing the POP finish date with the planned completion date from the DS04 table where the milestone level is 170 and the schedule type is Baseline (BL). 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the project is on track and not exceeding its planned completion date. If the POP finish date is later than the planned completion date, it could indicate potential delays in the project, which could lead to increased costs and other issues. 

The severity of this check is marked as a MAJOR. This means that while it's not an immediate threat to the data's integrity, it could cause problems during analysis. It's crucial to address this issue to ensure accurate project tracking and management.
