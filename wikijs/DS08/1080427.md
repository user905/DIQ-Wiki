The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "PM Authorization Missing" is designed to identify any instances in the DS08 Work Authorization Document (WAD) where a Project Management (PM) authorization date is missing. 

The error message "auth_PM_date is blank" indicates that the field for the PM authorization date (auth_PM_date) in the DS08 WAD is empty. This field is crucial as it records the date when the project management authorized the work. 

The likely cause of this error is that the PM authorization date was not entered or recorded in the DS08 WAD. This could be due to an oversight during data entry or a technical issue during data import. 

The expected value for the auth_PM_date field is a valid date. If this field is blank, it may affect the accuracy and completeness of the project management data. Therefore, it is important to ensure that a valid PM authorization date is entered in the DS08 WAD.

This test is being performed to check if the Work Authorization Document (WAD) in the DS08 WAD table has a Project Manager (PM) authorization date. The PM authorization date is crucial as it signifies when the PM approved the work to commence. 

The severity of this test is marked as a MAJOR, which means that while it may not immediately prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. The absence of a PM authorization date could lead to confusion about when the work was officially approved and could potentially impact project timelines and accountability.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring that all necessary approvals have been obtained before work begins on a project. This is a key aspect of maintaining data integrity and quality in project management, as it helps to ensure that all work is properly authorized and documented.
