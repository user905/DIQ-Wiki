Test Title: Initial Authorization Date Missing

Test Summary: This test checks if the initial authorization date is missing in the DS08 WAD table.

Error Message: "initial_auth_date is blank."

Explanation: This error occurs when the 'initial_auth_date' field in the DS08 WAD table is not filled. The 'initial_auth_date' field is crucial as it records the date when the project was initially authorized. If this field is left blank, it could lead to inaccuracies in project timelines and potentially impact project management decisions. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that the 'initial_auth_date' field is populated with the correct date when the project was initially authorized. The expected value for this field is a valid date.

This test is being performed to check if the 'initial authorization date' field in the 'DS08 WAD' table is missing or not. The initial authorization date is crucial as it marks the official start of the project or task, and is used for tracking and scheduling purposes. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. This is because without the initial authorization date, it would be difficult to track the progress of the project, calculate delays, or determine if the project is on schedule. 

Therefore, this check is important to ensure that all necessary data for effective project management is present and correct. If the initial authorization date is missing, it should be added to maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.
