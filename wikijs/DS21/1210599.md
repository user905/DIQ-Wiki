The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Negative Or Zero Rate Dollars" is performed on the DS21 Rates table. This check is designed to identify any instances where the rate, represented in dollars, is either negative or zero. 

The field causing the issue in this case is 'rate_dollars'. The expected values for this field should be positive numbers, as it is not logical or practical for a rate to be negative or zero in the context of EVMS construction project management data. 

If this DIQ check identifies any records where 'rate_dollars' is less than or equal to zero, it indicates that there may be errors or inconsistencies in the data entry process. These could be due to manual errors, system glitches, or incorrect calculations. 

To maintain the integrity and quality of the data, it is important to ensure that all rate values are positive numbers. Any records flagged by this DIQ check should be reviewed and corrected as necessary.

This test is being performed on the 'DS21 Rates' table to check for any instances where the rate in dollars is either negative or zero. The purpose of this test is to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. In the context of EVMS construction project management, having a negative or zero rate in dollars could lead to incorrect calculations or projections, which could in turn affect decision-making and overall project outcomes.

The severity of this check is classified as an MINOR. This means that while it may not immediately prevent the data from being reviewed or analyzed, it could potentially cause minor problems or indicate that the data does not adhere to all best practices. It's important to address these alerts to maintain the overall integrity and quality of the data.
