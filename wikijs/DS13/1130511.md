The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Profit Fee Earned Dollars Missing" is designed to identify any instances in the DS13 Subcontract table where the 'profit_fee_earned_dollars' field is either missing or has a value of zero. 

This field is crucial as it represents the profit fee earned from a subcontract. If this field is missing or zero, it could indicate that the data was not entered correctly or that the subcontract did not generate any profit fee, which might require further investigation.

The error is likely to be caused by either a data entry error, where the 'profit_fee_earned_dollars' field was not filled in, or a calculation error, where the profit fee earned was incorrectly calculated as zero. 

The expected value for the 'profit_fee_earned_dollars' field would be any positive number representing the profit fee earned from the subcontract. If the DIQ check identifies any instances where this field is missing or zero, these records should be reviewed and corrected as necessary.
