The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "EAC Dollars Missing" is performed on the DS13 Subcontract table. This check is designed to identify if there are any subcontracts where the Estimated at Completion (EAC) dollars are missing or have a value of zero.

The EAC dollars field is crucial in project management as it provides an estimate of the total cost of a project upon its completion. If this field is missing or zero, it could indicate that the data for the subcontract was not entered correctly or is incomplete.

If the DIQ check identifies any records where the EAC dollars are missing or zero, these records will be flagged for review. The expected value for the EAC dollars field should be a positive number representing the estimated cost at completion for the subcontract. 

Please ensure that all subcontracts have an appropriate EAC dollars value to maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.

This test is being performed to check if the Estimated at Completion (EAC) dollars are missing or zero in the 'DS13 Subcontract' table. The EAC is a forecast of what the total project will cost upon completion. It is a critical piece of information for project management as it helps in budgeting and financial planning. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. If EAC dollars are missing or zero, it could lead to inaccurate financial projections and potentially result in budget overruns. Therefore, this check is important to ensure the accuracy and completeness of financial data in the project management system.
