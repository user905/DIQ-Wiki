The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "MR Dollars Missing" is designed to identify any issues with the "MR_dollars" field in the DS13 Subcontract table. This check is crucial as it ensures that all subcontracts have an associated monetary value.

The error message "MR_dollars missing or 0" indicates that the "MR_dollars" field is either missing or has a value of zero. This could be due to a data entry error or omission during the data input process. 

The expected value for the "MR_dollars" field should be a positive monetary value. If the DIQ check identifies any records where this is not the case, these records will need to be reviewed and corrected to ensure data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed on the 'DS13 Subcontract' table to check if the 'MR Dollars' (most likely referring to Management Reserve Dollars) are missing or zero for a particular subcontract. The severity level is 'MAJOR', which implies that this issue could potentially cause problems during data analysis.

The importance of this check lies in the fact that the Management Reserve (MR) is a crucial part of project management, especially in the context of the EVMS (Earned Value Management System). It represents the budget set aside for unforeseen situations or risks that might occur during the project execution. If the MR dollars are missing or zero, it could indicate that the project is not adequately prepared for potential risks, which could lead to budget overruns or project delays. Therefore, this check is essential to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
