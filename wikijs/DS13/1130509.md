The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "MR Initial Dollars Missing" is designed to identify any issues with the "MR_initial_dollars" field in the DS13 Subcontract table. This check is crucial as it ensures that the initial dollars for Material Requisition (MR) are properly recorded for each subcontract.

If an error message stating "MR_initial_dollars missing or 0" is displayed, it indicates that the "MR_initial_dollars" field is either missing or has a value of zero. This is problematic as it suggests that the initial dollar amount for the Material Requisition (MR) is not properly recorded in the system.

The expected value for the "MR_initial_dollars" field should be a positive number, representing the initial dollar amount for the Material Requisition (MR). If the field is missing or zero, it could lead to inaccurate financial tracking and reporting for the subcontract.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the "MR_initial_dollars" field is properly filled with the correct initial dollar amount for each Material Requisition (MR) in the DS13 Subcontract table.

This test is being performed on the 'DS13 Subcontract' table to check if the 'MR Initial Dollars' field is missing or has a value of zero. The 'MR Initial Dollars' field is likely to represent the initial amount of money reserved for a particular subcontract. If this field is missing or zero, it could indicate that the initial budget for the subcontract was not properly recorded or allocated, which could lead to issues in financial tracking and project management.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. This could be because financial analyses or forecasts based on this data may be inaccurate if the initial budget for subcontracts is not correctly recorded. Therefore, this check is important to ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial data in the EVMS construction project management data.
