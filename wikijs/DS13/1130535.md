Summary: This Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check is designed to identify instances where the 'flow_down' field in the DS13 Subcontract table is missing or blank. 

Explanation: The 'flow_down' field is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data in the DS13 Subcontract table. It is expected to contain information about whether certain requirements are passed down from the prime contractor to the subcontractor. If this field is missing or blank, it could lead to incomplete or inaccurate data, which could potentially impact the overall project management process.

Error Message: "flow_down is missing or blank."

Resolution: If this error is encountered, it indicates that there are records in the DS13 Subcontract table where the 'flow_down' field is either missing or blank. To resolve this issue, you should review the data entry process for this table and ensure that the 'flow_down' field is properly filled in for each record.

This test is being performed on the 'DS13 Subcontract' table to check for the presence and correctness of the 'flow_down' field. The 'flow_down' field is crucial as it provides information about the transfer of responsibilities, obligations, or tasks from one entity to another in the subcontract. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which implies that if the 'flow_down' field is missing or blank, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis of the data. This could lead to incomplete or incorrect conclusions about the subcontract's management and execution.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the data. Without the 'flow_down' information, the understanding of the subcontract's structure and the distribution of responsibilities within it could be compromised. This could potentially lead to mismanagement or inefficiencies in the execution of the subcontract. Therefore, it is crucial to address this warning and ensure the 'flow_down' field is correctly filled in.
