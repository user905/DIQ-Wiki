The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "ACWP Dollars Missing" is designed to verify the presence and validity of the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) in dollars for each subcontract in the DS13 Subcontract dataset. 

The ACWP is a critical field that represents the actual cost incurred for the work performed within a given time period. If this field is missing or has a value of zero, it may indicate that the cost data for the subcontract has not been correctly entered or updated.

The error message "ACWPc_dollars missing or 0" is triggered when the ACWP in dollars (ACWPc_dollars) for a subcontract is either not present or is equal to zero. This could be due to a data entry error, a missing update, or a problem with the data source.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that the ACWPc_dollars field for each subcontract in the DS13 dataset is correctly filled with the actual cost incurred for the work performed. The expected value for this field should be a positive number representing the cost in dollars.

This test is being performed on the 'DS13 Subcontract' table to check if the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) in dollars is missing or zero. The ACWP is a crucial metric in project management as it represents the actual cost incurred for the work completed to date. This helps in tracking the financial performance of the project and aids in forecasting future costs.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which implies that if the ACWP data is missing or zero, it could potentially cause problems during the analysis of the project's financial performance. It might lead to inaccurate cost performance index calculations, incorrect budget forecasts, and could potentially mask issues related to cost overruns.

Therefore, this check is important to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the project's financial data, and to facilitate accurate project cost management and forecasting.
