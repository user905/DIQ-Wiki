The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Missing FC Finish" is designed to identify any instances in the DS13 Subcontract table where the forecast finish date (FC_finish_date) is missing. 

The FC_finish_date field is crucial for effective project management as it provides an estimate of when a particular subcontract is expected to be completed. If this field is missing, it could lead to inaccurate project timelines and inefficient resource allocation.

The error message "FC_finish_date missing" indicates that there are records in the DS13 Subcontract table where the FC_finish_date field is not filled in. This could be due to a data entry error or omission during the data input process.

To resolve this issue, it is recommended to review the data entry process for the DS13 Subcontract table and ensure that the FC_finish_date field is properly filled in for each record. The expected value for this field would be a valid date representing the forecasted finish date of the subcontract.

This test is being performed on the 'DS13 Subcontract' table to check if the forecast finish date (FC_finish_date) is missing. The severity level is 'MAJOR', which means that while it's not an immediate threat to the data's integrity, it could potentially cause problems during analysis. 

The importance of this check lies in the fact that the forecast finish date is a crucial piece of information in project management. It helps in tracking the progress of the project and in predicting if the project will be completed within the planned timeline. If this data is missing, it could lead to inaccurate project tracking and forecasting, which could potentially lead to delays and cost overruns. Therefore, it's important to ensure that this data is not missing.
