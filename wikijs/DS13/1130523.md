Test Title: Missing BL Finish

Table: DS13 Subcontract

Summary: This Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check is designed to identify if the baseline finish date (BL_finish_date) is missing in the DS13 Subcontract table.

Error Message: BL_finish_date is missing.

Explanation: This error is likely to occur when the baseline finish date (BL_finish_date) field in the DS13 Subcontract table is not populated. The baseline finish date is a critical piece of information for project management, as it indicates the planned completion date for a particular subcontract. If this field is left blank, it could lead to inaccuracies in project scheduling and tracking. Therefore, it is essential that each record in the DS13 Subcontract table has a valid baseline finish date. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that all records in the DS13 Subcontract table have a baseline finish date entered. If the baseline finish date for a subcontract is not known, it should be estimated and updated as soon as the accurate date is available.

This test is being performed on the 'DS13 Subcontract' table to check if the baseline finish date (BL_finish_date) is missing. The baseline finish date is a crucial piece of information in project management as it indicates the planned completion date for a particular task or project. If this data is missing, it could lead to problems in tracking project progress, estimating remaining work, and identifying potential delays.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. The absence of the baseline finish date could lead to inaccurate project timelines, incorrect resource allocation, and potential project delays. Therefore, it is important to address this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
