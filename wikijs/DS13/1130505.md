The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "BCWP Dollars Missing" is designed to verify the presence and validity of the BCWP (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed) in dollars for each subcontract in the DS13 Subcontract dataset. 

The BCWP is a critical field that represents the budgeted cost of work that has been completed. It is essential for accurate project management and financial tracking. If this field is missing or has a value of zero, it may indicate that the data for the subcontract has not been fully or correctly entered.

The error message "BCWPc_dollars missing or 0" is triggered when the BCWP in dollars is either not present or is equal to zero. This could be due to a data entry error, a problem with data transfer, or a lack of available data at the time of entry.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that the BCWP in dollars is correctly entered for each subcontract in the DS13 Subcontract dataset. The expected value for this field should be a positive number representing the budgeted cost of work that has been completed.

This test is being performed to check if the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) in dollars is missing or zero for a particular subcontract in the DS13 Subcontract table. BCWP is a critical parameter in Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS) as it represents the budgeted cost of work that has actually been performed. 

The importance of this check lies in its potential impact on the overall project management. If BCWP data is missing or zero, it could lead to inaccurate cost performance calculations, which could in turn affect project budgeting and scheduling decisions. 

The severity of this issue is marked as a MAJOR. This means that while the data can still be reviewed, the absence of BCWP data is likely to cause problems during analysis. It is recommended to address this issue to ensure accurate and reliable project management data.
