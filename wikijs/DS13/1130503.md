The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "BAC Dollars Missing" is performed on the DS13 Subcontract table. This check is designed to identify any instances where the Budget at Completion (BAC) in dollars is either missing or recorded as zero.

The BAC in dollars is a critical field in project management as it represents the total budget allocated for a particular subcontract. If this field is missing or zero, it could indicate that the budget information was not entered correctly or not entered at all.

The error message "BAC_dollars missing or 0" is displayed when the DIQ check identifies a record with this issue. To resolve this error, ensure that all subcontracts have a valid BAC in dollars entered. This value should be a positive number representing the total budget for the subcontract.

This test is being performed to check if the Budget at Completion (BAC) dollars are missing or zero in the 'DS13 Subcontract' table. The BAC is a crucial element in project management as it represents the total budget allocated to a particular subcontract. If the BAC is missing or zero, it could lead to inaccurate financial analysis and budgeting issues, which could potentially disrupt the project's progress.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not immediately halt the data review process, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis. It is important to address this issue promptly to ensure accurate financial tracking and to prevent potential budgeting problems in the future. This check is crucial to maintain the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data.
