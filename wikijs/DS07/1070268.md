## What causes this error?

> :robot: The following text was generated by an AI tool and hasn't been reviewed for accuracy by a human! It might be useful, but it also might have errors. Are you a human? You can help by reviewing it for accuracy! Edit it as needed then remove this message.

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Negative or Zero PM EAC Likely Dollars" is designed to identify any instances in the DS07 IPMR Header where the PM EAC Likely dollars value is zero or negative. 

The PM EAC Likely dollars field should ideally contain positive values, as it represents the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for the project, as predicted by the project manager (PM). A zero or negative value in this field could indicate an error in data entry or calculation.

If this DIQ check identifies any records with zero or negative values in the PM EAC Likely dollars field, it suggests that there may be inaccuracies in the project's financial data. These inaccuracies could potentially impact the overall project management and financial forecasting, and should therefore be corrected as soon as possible. 

To resolve this issue, review the data entries for the PM EAC Likely dollars field in the DS07 IPMR Header. Ensure that all values are positive and accurately reflect the project manager's estimated cost at completion.

This test is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table to check if the 'PM EAC Likely dollars' value is zero or negative. The 'PM EAC Likely dollars' field represents the Project Manager's Estimate at Completion in likely dollars. This value should ideally be a positive number as it represents the expected total cost of the project. A zero or negative value could indicate a data entry error or a miscalculation.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. For instance, a zero or negative value could skew budgetary analyses or lead to incorrect conclusions about the project's financial health.

Therefore, this check is important to ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial data in the project management system. It helps to maintain data integrity and quality by identifying potential issues that could impact financial reporting and decision-making.
