The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "PM EAC Best Date Misaligned with Cost Estimates" is designed to ensure that the Project Manager's (PM) best estimate at completion (EAC) date is not earlier than the last recorded estimate to complete (ETC) plus the estimated unburdened (UB) days. This check is performed on the DS07 IPMR Header table.

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it suggests that the PM's EAC date is set earlier than it should be, considering the last recorded ETC and the estimated UB days. This discrepancy could be due to an error in data entry or a miscalculation in the EAC, ETC, or UB estimates.

The fields involved in this check are the EAC_PM_best_date from the DS07 IPMR Header table, the period_date and ETCi (in hours, dollars, or FTEs) from the DS03 Cost table, and the UB_est_days from the DS07 IPMR Header table. 

The expected values for these fields should align such that the PM's EAC date is not earlier than the last recorded ETC plus the estimated UB days. If the EAC_PM_best_date is earlier, it suggests that the project is projected to complete before all estimated work and costs are accounted for, which could lead to inaccurate project planning and management.

This test is being performed to ensure that the Project Manager's (PM) Estimate at Completion (EAC) Best date is not earlier than the last recorded Estimate to Complete (ETC) plus the estimated Undistributed Budget (UB). The test is checking if the PM's best estimate for project completion is logically consistent with the remaining work and budget.

The importance of this check is to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the project's timeline and budget estimates. If the PM's EAC Best date is earlier than the last recorded ETC plus the estimated UB, it could indicate a potential error or inconsistency in the project's planning or tracking. This could lead to inaccurate forecasting, budgeting, and scheduling, which could negatively impact the project's management and outcomes.

The severity of this check is an MINOR, which means it is less severe but indicates there might be minor problems or that the data doesn't follow all best practices. It's not a critical error, but it's a potential issue that should be reviewed and corrected to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project's data.
