The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Zero Favorable Schedule Inc Dollar Threshold" is designed to verify the integrity of data in the DS07 IPMR Header table. Specifically, it checks whether the value in the field 'threshold_schedule_inc_dollar_fav' is equal to zero.

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that the 'threshold_schedule_inc_dollar_fav' field in the DS07 IPMR Header table contains a value that is not equal to zero. This field represents the favorable schedule increase dollar threshold for the project. As per the standard data requirements, this value should always be zero. 

If you encounter an error with this DIQ check, it is likely due to incorrect data entry or a data import error. Please review the data in the 'threshold_schedule_inc_dollar_fav' field of the DS07 IPMR Header table and correct any values that are not equal to zero.

This test is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table to check if the 'favorable schedule inc dollar threshold' is equal to zero. The severity of this test is marked as an 'MINOR', indicating that it is not a critical issue but could potentially cause minor problems or indicate that the data does not adhere to all best practices.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data. The 'favorable schedule inc dollar threshold' should ideally not be zero, as this could indicate a lack of budget allocation or a potential error in data entry. If this value is zero, it could potentially skew the analysis and lead to incorrect conclusions about the project's schedule and budget. Therefore, this check helps maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.
