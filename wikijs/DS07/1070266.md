The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "PM EAC Likely Date Earlier Than CPP SD" is designed to ensure that the Project Manager's Estimated At Completion (EAC) likely date is not earlier than the Current Period Performance (CPP) Status Date. This check is performed on the data in the DS07 IPMR Header table.

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it means that the EAC_PM_likely_date field contains a date that is earlier than the date in the CPP_status_date field. This is not expected, as the EAC likely date should be a future date, i.e., a date after the CPP Status Date.

To resolve this issue, you should review the dates in both the EAC_PM_likely_date and CPP_status_date fields. Ensure that the EAC_PM_likely_date is not earlier than the CPP_status_date. If it is, you will need to correct the EAC_PM_likely_date to a date that is later than the CPP_status_date.

This test is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table to check if the Project Manager's (PM) Estimated At Completion (EAC) likely date is earlier than the Current Period Performance (CPP) Status Date. The test is flagged as a MAJOR, indicating that if the PM's EAC likely date is indeed earlier than the CPP Status Date, it could cause issues during data analysis.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the logical consistency and temporal accuracy of the project management data. In a typical project timeline, the EAC date (the date when the project is expected to be completed) should not be earlier than the CPP Status Date (the date when the current performance of the project is assessed). If the EAC date is earlier, it suggests a potential error in data entry or project scheduling, which could lead to inaccurate project forecasting and planning. Therefore, this check is crucial for maintaining the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data.
