## What causes this error?

> :robot: The following text was generated by an AI tool and hasn't been reviewed for accuracy by a human! It might be useful, but it also might have errors. Are you a human? You can help by reviewing it for accuracy! Edit it as needed then remove this message.

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "High or Low Escalation Rate Percent" is designed to identify any unusual values in the "escalation_rate_pct" field in the DS07 IPMR Header table. This check is specifically looking for values that are exceptionally low (below 3%) or high (above 20%).

If this DIQ check flags any data, it means that the escalation rate percentage in the flagged records is either below 0.03 (3%) or above 0.2 (20%). These values are considered to be outside the normal range for this field.

The cause of this error could be a data entry error, a calculation error, or it could indicate an unusual situation in the project that may need further investigation. It's important to review any flagged records to determine the cause and decide on the appropriate action to take.

This test is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table to check the escalation rate percentage. The test is looking for values that are exceptionally low (below 3%) or high (above 20%). The purpose of this check is to ensure that the escalation rate percentage falls within a reasonable range. 

The importance of this check is to identify any potential errors or anomalies in the data that could affect the accuracy of project cost forecasts. An unusually low or high escalation rate could indicate a data entry error, or it could signal a significant change in project costs that needs to be investigated further. 

The severity of this check is classified as an 'MINOR'. This means that while it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, it's still important to address. If left unchecked, it could lead to minor problems or indicate that the data doesn't adhere to best practices. It's always best to ensure data integrity and quality for accurate and reliable project management.
