The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Negative UB Estimated (Dollars)" is designed to identify any instances in the DS07 IPMR Header where the Unbudgeted (UB) estimated dollars are recorded as a negative value. 

The UB estimated dollars field should typically contain positive values, as it represents the estimated cost of unbudgeted work in a project. A negative value in this field could indicate an error in data entry or calculation. 

If this DIQ check identifies any records with negative UB estimated dollars, it suggests that there may be inaccuracies in the project's financial data. These inaccuracies could potentially impact the overall project budget and financial reporting. Therefore, it is crucial to correct any negative values in the UB estimated dollars field to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the project's financial data.

This test is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table to check if the Undistributed Budget (UB) estimated dollars are negative. The Undistributed Budget refers to the portion of the total budget that has not yet been allocated to specific tasks or work packages. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the budget estimates are accurate and realistic. Having a negative value for the UB estimated dollars could indicate a mistake in the budget allocation or financial planning process. This could lead to financial mismanagement and could potentially disrupt the project's progress.

The severity of this check is marked as a 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not immediately prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis. It is crucial to address this issue to ensure accurate financial reporting and effective project management.
