# Multi-Row IPMR Header

## Basic Information
| Key         | Value          |
|-------------|----------------|
| Table       | DS07 IPMR Header |
| Severity    | CRITICAL |
| Unique ID   | 1070388   |
| Summary     | Is there more than one row in the IPMR header? |
| Error message | DS07 row count > 1. |

## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) test is triggering an error due to the number of rows in the DS07 IPMR Header data table. According to the conducted test, there should only be one unique row in the DS07 IPMR Header for a specific project. However, the test indicates that there is more than one record existing in the data set for the selected project, which would break the intended consistency of the data.

The field acting as a unique identifier for the header record should ideally have unique values. Its value seems to be duplicated in the DS07 IPMR Header, which is causing this issue. 

The solution involves ensuring that each project's information is correctly maintained with each other and should be unique. For example, if there are multiple rows with the same unique identifier, this indicates a data integrity issue. That's because the DIQ test has been created to ensure that only one header information row is present for each project, as per the DIQ check. This uniqueness is needed to maintain accurate relationships between the different data in the construction project database.

In order to address this, please inspect any data that is inserted into DS07 IPMR header, and ensure that duplicate rows for the same project are not being created.

In summary, the error is caused by the fact that the data presents multiple rows for the DS07 IPMR header for a single project, whereas the expected and acceptable condition is only one row of header data per project.
## Why do we check this?

This Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check is critical for ensuring high data quality in the EVMS construction project management data set at the U.S. Department of Energy. Specifically, this check is testing for the possibility of having more than one row in the Integrated Program Management Report (IPMR) header. The IPMR is an essential tool that the Department of Energy uses to assess project performance and progress, and thus it is crucial that the information it contains is accurate, reliable and organized in a coherent way.

The test is checking that there is only one unique identifier per PARS CPP Upload, as indicated by the parameter information given. In the case where 'DS07 row count > 1', this implies a violation of data integrity as there should only be one row in the IPMR header per PARS CPP Upload.

Failure to maintain this level of data integrity and quality could lead to complications in the data analysis part due to misleading information caused by duplicated headers. Discrepancies in data could lead to incorrect conclusions about the project's status, which could affect strategic decision making. 

This specific DIQ check aligns with best practices outlined in DOE Order 413.3B, which mandates rigorous project management practices, including strong data management, to ensure the successful delivery of Department of Energy projects. Furthermore, consistent and reliable data is a core requirement of the Departmentâ€™s focus on evidence-based policymaking and serves as the backbone for accurate project management and reporting. Therefore, conducting such DIQ checks is crucial for maintaining the standards set by DOE and upholding the project's success.
## How can I fix this in my source data system

The DIQ test that is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' is checking for more than one row in the IPMR header. This test is necessary because the IPMR header should only contain one row of data. If more than one row of data is present, this would indicate a data quality issue.

Here's how the contractor can resolve this issue within Deltek Cobra:

1. The contractor would need to log into Deltek Cobra and navigate to the relevant project containing the IPMR data.

2. Once in the project, they would need to depart to the IPMR Header section. This is where they can view all the IPMR Header rows that have been input into the system.

3. After identifying the IPMR Header rows, the contractor would need to evaluate each row. If there is more than one row, they need to determine which row is the correct one. This could be based on the most recent data, most accurate data, or data that aligns with other reports and checks.

4. Once the correct row has been identified, the contractor would need to delete the additional rows. To do this, select the row you want to delete, right-click, and select 'delete'. 

5. After deleting the extra rows, the contractor needs to re-validate the data in Deltek Cobra, ensuring that only one row remains in the IPMR Header.

6. Finally, re-upload the data to the PARS CPP Upload. 

After these steps, contractors should check the PARS DIQ Reports to ensure that the data now passes the DIQ check. It should show that the DS07 row count is equal to 1, meaning there's only one row in the IPMR Header.

Please remember that it's essential to keep a backup of your data before making changes, and confirm each change's necessity and accuracy before finalizing. Also, consider training for users on the importance of entering only one line of data in the IPMR Header section to prevent this error in the future.
