The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Zero Favorable Cost VAC Dollar Threshold" is designed to verify the integrity of data in the DS07 IPMR Header table. Specifically, it checks whether the favorable cost Variance at Completion (VAC) dollar threshold is equal to zero.

If the DIQ check returns an error, it means that the 'threshold_cost_VAC_dollar_fav' field in the DS07 IPMR Header table has a value of zero. This could be due to an error in data entry or a problem with the data source. 

The 'threshold_cost_VAC_dollar_fav' field should ideally contain a positive value, representing the dollar threshold for favorable cost variance at completion. A zero value in this field could potentially distort the project's financial analysis and forecasts. 

To resolve this issue, you should review the data source or the data entry process to ensure that the 'threshold_cost_VAC_dollar_fav' field is correctly populated with the appropriate positive values.

This test is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table to check if the favorable cost Variance at Completion (VAC) dollar threshold is equal to zero. The Variance at Completion (VAC) is a projection of the anticipated budget surplus or deficit at the project's completion. A favorable cost VAC indicates that the project is expected to be under budget. 

The test is important because if the threshold is set to zero, it means that any amount of favorable cost VAC, no matter how small, will trigger an alert. This could potentially lead to an overwhelming number of alerts, even for minor favorable variances that may not be significant in the context of the overall project budget. 

The severity of this check is classified as an MINOR. This means that while it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, it's still a potential problem. It might cause minor issues during data analysis or indicate that the data doesn't follow all best practices. It's recommended to review and adjust the threshold as necessary to ensure meaningful alerts.
