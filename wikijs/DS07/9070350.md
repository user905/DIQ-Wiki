The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "PM EAC Best Misaligned with Calculated EAC" is designed to ensure that the Project Manager's Estimate at Completion (PM EAC) in Best dollars is not less than the calculated Estimate at Completion (EAC). This check is performed on the DS07 IPMR Header table.

The calculated EAC is the sum of the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) and the Estimate to Complete (ETC) from the DS03 Cost table, plus the Undistributed Budget (UB) estimate in dollars from the DS07 IPMR Header table. If the PM EAC Best dollars value is less than this calculated EAC, the DIQ check will flag an error.

The fields causing the issue are the EAC_PM_Best_dollars field in the DS07 IPMR Header table and the ACWPi_dollars, ETCi_dollars, and UB_est_dollars fields in the DS03 Cost and DS07 IPMR Header tables. 

The expected values should be such that the PM EAC Best dollars value is not less than the sum of ACWP, ETC, and UB estimate in dollars. If the PM EAC Best dollars value is less, it indicates a potential misalignment in the project's financial planning and execution, which needs to be addressed.

This test is being performed to ensure that the Project Manager's (PM) Estimate at Completion (EAC) Best dollars value is not less than the cost-calculated EAC. The cost-calculated EAC is the sum of the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWPc), the Estimate to Complete (ETCc), and the Undistributed Budget (UB) estimate in dollars. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the PM's EAC is not underestimating the actual cost of the project. If the PM's EAC is less than the cost-calculated EAC, it could lead to budget shortfalls and project delays. 

The severity of this check is an MINOR, which means it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, but it's a potential problem that could cause minor issues during analysis. It's also an indication that the data may not be following best practices for project cost estimation.
