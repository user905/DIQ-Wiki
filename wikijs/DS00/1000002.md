| Unique ID   | 1000002   |

| Error message | DS00.CPP_Status_Date > min DS04.ES_date or EF_date where milestone_level = 190. |

## What causes this error?


The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CPP Status Date Is After CD-4" is designed to ensure that the Critical Decision-4 (CD-4) date is not later than the Contractor Project Performance (CPP) status date. This check is performed on the DS00 Metadata table.

The error message "DS00.CPP_Status_Date > min DS04.ES_date or EF_date where milestone_level = 190" indicates that the CPP status date in the DS00 Metadata table is later than the early start (ES) date or early finish (EF) date in the DS04 Schedule table on the task with milestone level  190 (which corresponds to CD-4 approval).

This error is likely caused by incorrect data entry. The CPP status date should not be later than the CD-4 date, as this would imply that the project has moved to a new phase before the completion of the CD-4 milestone. 

To resolve this issue, please ensure that the CPP status date in the DS00 Metadata table is not later than the earliest start (ES) date or earliest finish (EF) date in the DS04 Schedule table for the CD-4 milestone.
## Why do we check this?

This test is being performed to ensure that the Contractor Project Performance (CPP) Status Date is not later than the Critical Decision-4 (CD-4) date. The CD-4 date represents the project completion milestone and the CPP Status Date should ideally be on or before this date. 

The importance of this check is to maintain the chronological integrity of the project management data. If the CPP Status Date is after the CD-4 date, it could indicate a data entry error or a significant project management issue, such as a delay in updating the CD-4 status. 

The severity of this test is marked as a MAJOR. This means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it could potentially cause problems during data analysis. For instance, it could lead to incorrect conclusions about the project timeline or the efficiency of the project management process. Therefore, it is important to address this issue to ensure accurate and reliable data analysis.
