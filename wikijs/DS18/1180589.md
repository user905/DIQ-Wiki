The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check for the DS18 Sched EU table, titled "EU Minimum Days Greater Than Likely", is designed to ensure that the Estimated Unit (EU) minimum days are not greater than the likely days. 

The error message "EU_min_days > EU_likely_days" indicates that there are instances where the EU minimum days are incorrectly recorded as being more than the likely days. This discrepancy could be due to data entry errors or issues with the source data.

The fields causing the issue are 'EU_min_days' and 'EU_likely_days'. The expected values should be such that the 'EU_min_days' is less than or equal to 'EU_likely_days'. 

If this error is flagged, it is recommended to review the data entries for these fields in the DS18 Sched EU table and correct any inconsistencies to ensure data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed on the 'DS18 Sched EU' table to check if the 'EU minimum days' are greater than the 'likely days'. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the estimated minimum duration of a task or activity is not exceeding the likely duration. This is important because it helps in maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the project schedule. If the minimum days are greater than the likely days, it could lead to unrealistic or incorrect project timelines, which could further impact project planning and execution.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MINOR', which means it is not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, but it is still important to address. If not corrected, it could lead to minor problems in data analysis or indicate that the data does not follow all best practices. Therefore, it is recommended to review and correct this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
