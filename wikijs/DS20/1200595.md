The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Duplicate Calendar Exception" is designed to identify any instances where the same calendar exception appears more than once in the DS20 Sched CAL Exception table. This is determined by checking for duplicates based on the combination of the 'calendar_name' and 'exception_date' fields.

If the DIQ check identifies any duplicates, it means that there are multiple entries for the same calendar exception, which could lead to confusion or errors in the project management data. The expected values for the 'calendar_name' and 'exception_date' fields should be unique combinations for each calendar exception.

To resolve this issue, you should review the data in the DS20 Sched CAL Exception table and remove any duplicate calendar exceptions. This will ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.

This test, titled "Duplicate Calendar Exception," is being performed on the 'DS20 Sched CAL Exception' table to identify any instances where the combination of 'calendar_name' and 'exception_date' is duplicated. The purpose of this test is to ensure that there are no redundant entries in the calendar exception data, which could lead to confusion or inaccuracies in the project management timeline.

The severity of this test is marked as 'CRITICAL', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if any duplicates are found, they must be resolved before the data can be further reviewed or used for analysis. This is crucial because duplicate entries can distort the data analysis, leading to incorrect conclusions and potentially flawed decision-making. Therefore, maintaining data integrity and quality through this check is of utmost importance for the accuracy and reliability of the EVMS construction project management data at the US Department of Energy.
