The DIQ check titled "WP-Level VAR Mistype In WBS Dictionary" is designed to ensure that the Work Package (WP) level Variance (VAR) type aligns with the type specified in the WBS Dictionary (DS01). 

This check is performed on the 'DS11 Variance' table and it verifies that for each record where the 'narrative_type' is '500', the corresponding 'type' in the 'DS01 WBS' table is 'WP'. 

If an error is flagged by this check, it is likely due to a misalignment between the VAR type in the 'DS11 Variance' table and the type in the 'DS01 WBS' table. Specifically, the error is caused when a record in the 'DS11 Variance' table has a 'narrative_type' of '500', but the corresponding record in the 'DS01 WBS' table does not have a 'type' of 'WP'. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that for each 'narrative_type' of '500' in the 'DS11 Variance' table, the corresponding 'type' in the 'DS01 WBS' table is 'WP'.

This test is being performed on the 'DS11 Variance' table to check for any discrepancies in the Work Package (WP) level Variance Analysis Report (VAR) type in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Dictionary. The test is checking if the WP-level VAR type is listed as something other than 'WP' in the WBS Dictionary, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data.

The importance of this check is to ensure that the VAR type is correctly classified in the WBS Dictionary. If the VAR type is misclassified, it could lead to incorrect data analysis and reporting, which could potentially impact project management decisions. 

The severity of this check is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during data analysis. Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.
