| Table       | DS11 Variance |
| Severity    | MAJOR |
| Unique ID   | 9110492   |
| Summary     | Is this SLPP-level VAR type as something other than SLPP in the WBS Dictionary? |
| Error message | narrative_type = 200 & DS01.type <> SLPP (by WBS_ID). |

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "SLPP-Level VAR Mistype In WBS Dictionary" is designed to identify any discrepancies between the Variance (VAR) type at the SLPP level in the DS11 Variance table and the corresponding type in the DS01 WBS Dictionary table. 

The error is likely to occur when the 'narrative_type' field in the DS11 Variance table is set to '200', but the corresponding 'type' field in the DS01 WBS Dictionary table is not set to 'SLPP'. This discrepancy indicates a misalignment between the two tables, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data.

The expected value for the 'type' field in the DS01 WBS Dictionary table, when the 'narrative_type' in the DS11 Variance table is '200', should be 'SLPP'. If the DIQ check identifies any records that do not meet this expectation, it suggests that there may be an error in the data entry or transfer process that needs to be addressed.

This test is being performed on the 'DS11 Variance' table to check for any discrepancies in the SLPP-level VAR type in the WBS Dictionary. The test is checking if the SLPP-level VAR type is listed as something other than 'SLPP'. This is done by comparing the 'narrative_type' value of 200 with the 'DS01.type' value, which should be 'SLPP' for the same 'WBS_ID'. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the data in the WBS Dictionary is consistent and accurate. If the SLPP-level VAR type is listed as something other than 'SLPP', it could lead to confusion and potential errors in data analysis. This could further lead to incorrect project management decisions, impacting the overall success of the project. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the data.
