The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CC Log ID Missing in CC Log" is designed to verify the consistency of data between the DS10 CC Log Detail and DS09 CC Log tables. Specifically, it checks whether the CC Log ID for a transaction recorded in the DS10 CC Log Detail table is also present in the DS09 CC Log table.

If an error message "CC_log_ID not in DS09.CC_log_ID list" is returned, it indicates that there are one or more CC Log IDs in the DS10 CC Log Detail table that cannot be found in the DS09 CC Log table. This discrepancy could be due to data entry errors, missing data, or synchronization issues between the two tables.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that every CC Log ID in the DS10 CC Log Detail table corresponds to a valid CC Log ID in the DS09 CC Log table. The expected values for the CC Log ID field should be identical in both tables. If a CC Log ID is present in the DS10 CC Log Detail table, it should also exist in the DS09 CC Log table.

This test is being performed to ensure that every transaction in the 'DS10 CC Log Detail' table has a corresponding 'CC Log ID' in the 'CC Log' table. The 'CC Log ID' is a unique identifier for each transaction and is crucial for linking data across different tables. 

The importance of this check is to maintain the integrity and consistency of the data. If a 'CC Log ID' is missing, it could lead to issues during data analysis, such as incorrect results or inability to track specific transactions. This could potentially impact decision-making processes based on this data.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that while it's not an immediate threat to the overall data review, it's likely to cause problems during analysis if not addressed. Therefore, it's recommended to fix this issue to ensure accurate and efficient data analysis.

		*
	FROM 
		DS10_CC_log_detail
