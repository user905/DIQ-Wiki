The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Dollars Delta Missing" is designed to verify the integrity of the data in the DS10 CC Log Detail table. This check specifically focuses on the 'dollars_delta' field of each transaction.

The 'dollars_delta' field represents the change in dollar value for a particular transaction. If this field is missing or has a value of zero, it indicates that there is no recorded change in dollar value for the transaction, which could be a result of data entry errors or system issues.

The DIQ check identifies any records where the 'dollars_delta' field is either missing or zero. If such records are found, it means that there is an issue with the data integrity and quality for those specific transactions. The expected value for the 'dollars_delta' field should be a non-zero number that accurately reflects the change in dollar value for the transaction.

If the DIQ check returns any records, it is recommended to review the data entry process for the 'dollars_delta' field to ensure that all changes in dollar value are being accurately recorded.

This test is being performed on the 'DS10 CC Log Detail' table to check if the 'dollars_delta' for a transaction is missing or zero. The 'dollars_delta' field is crucial as it represents the change in dollar value for a particular transaction. If this field is missing or zero, it could indicate that the transaction was not recorded correctly or not updated after changes.

The severity of this test is marked as 'MINOR', which is less severe but still important. It indicates that there might be minor problems with the data or that the data doesn't follow all best practices. This could potentially lead to inaccuracies in financial reporting or analysis, which is why this check is important.

The purpose of this Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check is to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the financial data in the EVMS construction project management data. It helps in maintaining the integrity of the data and ensures that all transactions are correctly recorded and updated.
