The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WBS Missing In WBS Dictionary" is designed to verify the consistency of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) identifiers in the DS10 CC Log Detail table. 

The WBS ID is a critical field that should be consistent across different tables. In this case, the DIQ check is ensuring that every WBS ID in the DS10 CC Log Detail table is also present in the DS01 WBS Dictionary. 

If an error message "WBS_ID missing in DS01.WBS_ID list" is returned, it indicates that there are one or more WBS IDs in the DS10 CC Log Detail table that could not be found in the DS01 WBS Dictionary. This discrepancy could be due to a data entry error, a missing entry in the DS01 WBS Dictionary, or a mismatch in the WBS ID format between the two tables.

To resolve this issue, you should cross-check the WBS IDs in the DS10 CC Log Detail table with those in the DS01 WBS Dictionary. Ensure that all WBS IDs in the DS10 table have corresponding entries in the DS01 table. If any mismatches or missing entries are found, they should be corrected to maintain data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed to ensure that all Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) IDs in the 'DS10 CC Log Detail' table are also present in the WBS Dictionary. The WBS ID is a crucial element in project management as it provides a structured view into the project and is used to organize and define the total scope of the project. 

The severity of this test is marked as a 'MAJOR', which implies that if the issue is not addressed, it is likely to cause problems during data analysis. This could potentially lead to inaccurate project tracking, budgeting, and resource allocation, which could negatively impact the overall project management.

The importance of this check lies in maintaining the integrity and quality of the project management data. Ensuring that all WBS IDs are included in the WBS Dictionary helps to maintain consistency and accuracy in the data, which is essential for effective project management and decision-making.
