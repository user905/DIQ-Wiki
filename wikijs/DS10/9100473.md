The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "POP Finish Misaligned with WAD (CA)" is designed to identify any discrepancies between the Planned Completion Date (POP Finish) for a Control Account (CA) in the DS10 CC Log Detail table and the corresponding date in the DS08 WAD table. 

The test operates by comparing the POP Finish Date for each Control Account in the DS10 CC Log Detail table with the latest revision of the same date in the DS08 WAD table. If there is a mismatch between these two dates, the test will flag an error.

The error is likely caused by inconsistent updates between the two tables. For instance, if the POP Finish Date for a Control Account is updated in the DS10 CC Log Detail table but not in the DS08 WAD table, or vice versa, the test will identify a discrepancy.

The fields causing the issue are the POP_finish_date in both the DS10 CC Log Detail and DS08 WAD tables. The expected values for these fields should be identical for each Control Account, reflecting the most recent planned completion date.

To resolve this issue, ensure that any updates to the POP Finish Date for a Control Account are consistently applied to both the DS10 CC Log Detail and DS08 WAD tables.

This test is being performed on the 'DS10 CC Log Detail' table to check if the Planned Completion Date (POP Finish) for a particular Control Account is not aligned with the date in the Work Authorization Document (WAD). The test is comparing the POP_finish_date in the current table with the POP_finish_date in the DS08 table. This check is performed at the Control Account (CA) level and the results are grouped by the Work Breakdown Structure ID (WBS_ID).

The severity of this test is marked as 'MAJOR', which means that if the issue is not addressed, it could potentially cause problems during the analysis of the data. The misalignment of dates could lead to incorrect project timelines, budget overruns, or misallocation of resources.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the project management data. It helps in maintaining a consistent and accurate project schedule, which is crucial for effective project management and for making informed decisions. It also ensures that the project is being executed as per the authorized plan.
