Now, it joins DS04 Tasks to their DS06 Resources with a budget by task ID and subproject ID, and groups by DS04 WBS ID & DS06 EOC, incorporating a condition to match subproject IDs.\n\nLogic remains unchanged for identifying cost data with no accompanying resources (DS06) and for the criteria used to determine missing joins as failed rows.

The logic was adjusted to accommodate a new distinction between direct and indirect costs, specifically by treating certain costs as \"Indirect\" based on a new indicator, rather than directly aligning them with existing categories.

The function now considers both `task_id` and `subproject_ID` when joining schedule data to resources, where previously it only considered `task_id`. This allows for a more granular matching process.\n3. The grouping logic in several parts of the function has been updated to group by a new case condition that accounts for the indirect cost indicator, and also to include `subproject_ID` where applicable. This change ensures that costs are grouped correctly considering the new indirect cost distinction.\n4. Function name remains unchanged.",
