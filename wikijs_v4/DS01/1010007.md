The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "SLPP with Child" is designed to verify the hierarchical structure within the DS01 WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) table. Specifically, it checks whether any SLPP (Summary Level Planning Package) has a child in the WBS hierarchy.

The SLPP is a type of work package in the WBS hierarchy and it should not have any child elements. If the DIQ check returns a message stating "SLPP found with child in the WBS hierarchy", it indicates that there is an inconsistency in the data structure. 

The fields causing this issue are the 'parent_WBS_ID' and 'WBS_ID' fields in the DS01 WBS table. The 'parent_WBS_ID' field should not contain any 'WBS_ID' that is associated with an SLPP type. 

To resolve this issue, review the WBS hierarchy and ensure that no SLPP types are assigned as parents to other elements. The expected values for the 'parent_WBS_ID' field should not include any 'WBS_ID' associated with an SLPP type.

This test is being performed to check the hierarchical structure of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in the DS01 WBS table. Specifically, it is checking whether a Summary Level Planning Package (SLPP) has a child in the WBS hierarchy. 

The importance of this check is to ensure the correct organization and structure of the WBS. In project management, the WBS is a key tool that breaks down a project into manageable sections. If an SLPP, which is typically a higher-level planning package, has a child in the hierarchy, it could indicate a potential issue with the structure of the project plan. 

The severity of this test is marked as a WARNING. This means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis of the project management data. It is crucial to address this issue to ensure accurate and efficient project planning and management.
