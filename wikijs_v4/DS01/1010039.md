The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Parent WBS ID Missing In WBS List" is designed to ensure that every Parent Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID listed in the DS01 WBS table is also present in the WBS ID list of the same table. 

The error message "Parent WBS ID not found in the WBS ID list" indicates that there are instances where a Parent WBS ID does not have a corresponding entry in the WBS ID list. This discrepancy can cause issues in the project management data, as it disrupts the hierarchical structure of the WBS, which is crucial for effective project planning and control.

The fields causing this issue are the 'parent_WBS_ID' and 'WBS_ID'. The expected values for these fields are that every 'parent_WBS_ID' should have a corresponding 'WBS_ID' in the WBS ID list. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that every Parent WBS ID listed in the DS01 WBS table has a matching entry in the WBS ID list. This will maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.

This test is being performed to ensure that every Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID has a corresponding Parent WBS ID in the WBS ID list. The Work Breakdown Structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The Parent WBS ID is crucial as it provides a hierarchical structure to the project tasks, allowing for efficient organization and tracking.

The severity of this test is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if a Parent WBS ID is missing, it is a critical issue that must be fixed before the data can be reviewed. This is because without the Parent WBS ID, the hierarchical structure of the project tasks would be disrupted, leading to potential mismanagement and confusion in project execution.

Therefore, this check is of utmost importance to ensure the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data. It ensures that all tasks are properly organized and traceable, which is crucial for effective project management and successful project execution.
