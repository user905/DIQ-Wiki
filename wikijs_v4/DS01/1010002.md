The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WBS Level Contiguity" is designed to ensure that the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) levels in the DS01 WBS table are contiguous in the WBS hierarchy. This means that each level in the hierarchy should follow sequentially from the previous level without any gaps.

If an error message stating "WBS level is not contiguous with prior levels in the WBS hierarchy" is received, it indicates that there is a discrepancy in the sequence of the WBS levels. This discrepancy could be due to a missing level in the hierarchy or an incorrectly assigned level.

The fields causing this issue are the 'level' field in both the parent and child records of the DS01 WBS table. The expected values for these fields should be sequential integers, with each child level being exactly one greater than its parent level. For example, if a parent record has a 'level' value of 2, the child record should have a 'level' value of 3.

To resolve this issue, review the WBS hierarchy in the DS01 WBS table and ensure that the 'level' values are correctly assigned and follow a contiguous sequence.

This test, titled "WBS Level Contiguity," is being performed on the 'DS01 WBS' table to ensure that the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) levels are contiguous in the WBS hierarchy. The Work Breakdown Structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The contiguity of WBS levels is crucial for maintaining a logical and efficient structure for project management.

The severity of this test is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if the WBS levels are not contiguous, it is a critical issue that must be fixed before the data can be reviewed. If not addressed, it could lead to significant problems in project management, such as confusion in task allocation, difficulty in tracking project progress, and potential delays in project completion.

Therefore, this check is of utmost importance as it ensures the integrity and quality of the project management data, which is essential for the successful execution and completion of the EVMS construction project at the US Department of Energy.
