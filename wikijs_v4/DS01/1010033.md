The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check with ID '9' is designed to ensure that the root of your Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) hierarchy is of the correct type, specifically 'WBS'. This check is performed on the data in the DS01 WBS table.

The test is checking the 'Type' and 'Level' fields of the WBS hierarchy. The 'Type' field should contain the value 'WBS' and the 'Level' field should be '1' for the root of the hierarchy. If the root of your WBS hierarchy is of a type other than 'WBS', this will trigger an error message stating 'Level 1 WBS element not of type WBS.'

The likely cause of this error is incorrect data entry in the 'Type' field for the root of the WBS hierarchy. Please ensure that the root of your WBS hierarchy is correctly classified as 'WBS' in the 'Type' field.

This test is being performed to ensure that the top element of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) hierarchy is of the type 'WBS'. The Work Breakdown Structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The top element of the WBS hierarchy should be of the type 'WBS' to ensure that the structure is correctly organized and that all subsequent elements fall under the correct hierarchy.

The severity of this test is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if the top element of the WBS hierarchy is not of the type 'WBS', it is a critical issue that must be fixed before the data can be reviewed. This is important because if the WBS hierarchy is not correctly structured, it could lead to significant issues in project management, such as incorrect task allocation, inaccurate project tracking, and ultimately, project failure. Therefore, this check is crucial to ensure the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data.
