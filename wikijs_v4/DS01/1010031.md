The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WBS ID Missing Delimiters" is designed to ensure that the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID in the DS01 WBS table is correctly formatted. The WBS ID should include delimiters, specifically periods, to separate different levels of the WBS. 

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that one or more WBS IDs in the DS01 WBS table are missing these delimiters. This could be due to a data entry error or a problem with the system that generated the WBS IDs. 

The WBS ID field is the one causing the issue. The expected value for this field is a string that includes one or more periods as delimiters. For example, a WBS ID might look like "1.2.3" or "1.1", depending on the number of levels in the WBS. 

Please ensure that all WBS IDs are correctly formatted with the appropriate delimiters to maintain data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed to check if the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID in the DS01 WBS table is missing delimiters, specifically periods. The WBS ID is a unique identifier used to track tasks in a project. It is typically structured with periods (.) as delimiters to separate different levels of tasks and subtasks. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the WBS IDs are correctly formatted. If the delimiters are missing, it could lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the WBS IDs, which could subsequently lead to errors in project management and tracking. 

The severity of this check is marked as a WARNING. This means that while the data can still be reviewed, the missing delimiters are likely to cause problems during analysis. It is recommended to fix this issue to ensure accurate and efficient data analysis.
