The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Root of WBS not unique" is designed to ensure that the root of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) hierarchy, also known as Level 1, is unique within the DS01 WBS table. 

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that there is more than one Level 1 WBS element in the data. This is problematic because the root of the WBS hierarchy should be unique to maintain a clear and organized structure of the project. 

To resolve this issue, review the data in the DS01 WBS table, specifically the 'Level' field. Ensure that there is only one entry with a 'Level' value of 1. If there are multiple entries with a 'Level' value of 1, you will need to adjust the data so that only one unique Level 1 WBS element exists.

This test is being performed to ensure that the root of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) hierarchy is unique. The Work Breakdown Structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. Having a unique root for the WBS hierarchy is crucial for maintaining a clear and organized structure. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if the root of the WBS hierarchy is not unique, it is a critical issue that must be fixed before the data can be reviewed. If not corrected, it could lead to confusion, misinterpretation of data, and potential errors in project management and execution. 

Therefore, this check is of utmost importance to ensure the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data. It helps in maintaining a clear, organized, and effective project management structure, which is crucial for the successful execution of the project.
