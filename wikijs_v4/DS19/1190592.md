The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check for the DS19 Sched CAL Std table, titled "Hours Per Day Less Than Zero Or Greater Than 24", is designed to identify any instances where the 'hours_per_day' field contains values that are either less than zero or greater than 24. 

This check is important because the 'hours_per_day' field should logically only contain values between 0 and 24, inclusive. Any values outside this range would indicate an error in the data entry or processing stages. 

If this DIQ check returns any records, it means that there are entries in the 'hours_per_day' field that are either negative or exceed 24. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as manual data entry errors, system glitches, or incorrect calculations. 

To resolve this issue, you should review the identified records and correct the 'hours_per_day' values to fall within the acceptable range of 0 to 24. This will ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project management data in the DS19 Sched CAL Std table.

This test is being performed on the 'DS19 Sched CAL Std' table to ensure that the 'hours per day' values are within a logical and acceptable range, specifically between 0 and 24. The importance of this check is to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the data. If the 'hours per day' values are less than 0 or greater than 24, it could lead to incorrect calculations or analyses, as these values are not realistic or possible in the context of a day's hours. The severity level is 'WARNING', which means that while this issue may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis if not addressed.
