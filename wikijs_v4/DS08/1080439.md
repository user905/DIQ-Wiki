The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CA & WP WBS Match" is performed on the DS08 WAD table. This check is designed to ensure that the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) IDs for both the Control Account (CA) and Work Package (WP) match. 

The WBS ID is a unique identifier used to track and manage work packages and control accounts in a project. If the WBS IDs for the CA and WP do not match, it could indicate a data entry error or a misalignment in the project structure. 

The error message "WBS_ID = WBS_ID_WP" indicates that the WBS ID for the Control Account (CA) should be the same as the WBS ID for the Work Package (WP). If this is not the case, the DIQ check will fail. 

To resolve this issue, review the WBS IDs for both the Control Account and Work Package in the DS08 WAD table. Ensure that these IDs match exactly. If they do not, correct the data entry error or realign the project structure as necessary. 

Remember, maintaining data integrity and quality is crucial for accurate project management and reporting. Regularly performing DIQ checks like the "CA & WP WBS Match" can help identify and correct potential issues early, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of your project data.

This test is being performed to ensure that the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) IDs for Contract Account (CA) and Work Package (WP) in the DS08 WAD table match. The WBS is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The WBS IDs for CA and WP should ideally be the same to maintain consistency and accuracy in the data.

The importance of this check is to prevent potential issues during data analysis. If the WBS IDs do not match, it could lead to confusion, misinterpretation of data, and potential errors in project management and reporting. This could further lead to incorrect decision-making based on inaccurate data.

The severity of this check is marked as a WARNING. This means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis if not addressed. Therefore, it is recommended to correct this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
