The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "POP Finish Before Cost Finish (CA)" is designed to ensure that the Period of Performance (POP) finish date for a given Control Account Work Authorization Document (WAD) in DS08 WAD table is not earlier than the last recorded Schedule Performance Analysis Evaluation (SPAE) value in the DS03 cost table.

The error message "pop_finish_date < max DS03.period_date where BCWS, BCWP, ACWP, or ETC <> 0 (by CA WBS ID)" indicates that the POP finish date is earlier than the maximum period date in DS03 where any of the following fields are not equal to zero: Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS), Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP), Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP), or Estimate to Complete (ETC). This is determined on a per Control Account Work Breakdown Structure (CA WBS) ID basis.

This error is likely caused by incorrect or inconsistent data entry in the DS08 WAD and DS03 cost tables. The POP finish date in the DS08 WAD table should not be earlier than the last recorded SPAE value in the DS03 cost table. If it is, this suggests that there may be cost data recorded after the project was supposed to have finished, which could indicate a data entry error or a problem with the project timeline. 

To resolve this issue, review the POP finish dates in the DS08 WAD table and the SPAE values in the DS03 cost table for the affected CA WBS IDs. Ensure that the POP finish dates are not earlier than the last recorded SPAE values. If necessary, update the POP finish dates in the DS08 WAD table or the SPAE values in the DS03 cost table to correct the data.

This test is being performed to ensure that the Planned Order of Performance (POP) finish date for a specific Control Account Work Authorization Document (WAD) is not set before the last recorded Schedule Performance Analysis Evaluation (SPAE) value in cost. This is important because it checks for logical consistency in the project timeline. If the POP finish date is before the last cost recording, it implies that costs are being recorded after the project is supposed to have been completed, which could indicate a problem with either the scheduling or cost recording processes.

The severity of this check is marked as a WARNING. This means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. For instance, it could lead to inaccurate cost performance analysis or flawed project timeline predictions. Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue to ensure accurate and reliable project management data.
