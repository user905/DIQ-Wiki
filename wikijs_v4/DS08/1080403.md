The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check for the DS08 Work Authorization Document (WAD) table is designed to ensure that there are no instances where labor hours are recorded without corresponding labor dollars. This is important because labor hours and labor dollars should always be associated with each other in project management data.

The DIQ check is titled "Labor Hours without Labor Dollars". It is checking for instances where the 'budget_labor_hours' field is greater than zero, but the 'budget_labor_dollars' field is equal to zero. This would indicate that labor hours have been recorded, but no corresponding labor dollars have been allocated.

If this DIQ check returns any records, it means that there are entries in the DS08 WAD table where labor hours have been recorded without corresponding labor dollars. This could be due to a data entry error, or it could indicate a problem with the process used to input labor data into the system.

To resolve this issue, you should review the entries in the DS08 WAD table that are returned by this DIQ check. Ensure that for every entry where 'budget_labor_hours' is greater than zero, there is a corresponding value in the 'budget_labor_dollars' field. If 'budget_labor_hours' is greater than zero, 'budget_labor_dollars' should also be greater than zero.

This test is being performed to ensure that there is a corresponding labor cost for every labor hour recorded in the 'DS08 WAD' table. The test checks if there are any instances where labor hours are greater than zero but the labor dollars are equal to zero. 

The importance of this check is to maintain the accuracy and consistency of the data. In a typical scenario, labor hours should always have an associated labor cost. If there are labor hours without labor dollars, it could indicate a data entry error or a problem with the system that calculates labor costs. 

The severity level of this test is 'ALERT', which means it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed. However, it's still important to address this issue as it could potentially cause minor problems in the data analysis or indicate that the data doesn't follow all best practices.
