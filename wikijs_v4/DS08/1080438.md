The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check for the DS08 Work Authorization Document (WAD) table is designed to ensure that the Work Package Manager's (WPM) authorization date is not later than the Control Account Manager's (CAM) authorization date. 

The test is titled "WPM Authorization Date After CAM Authorization Date" and it checks if the WPM's authorization date (auth_WPM_date) is later than the CAM's authorization date (auth_CAM_date). If the WPM's authorization date is found to be later than the CAM's, this would be flagged as an error.

The likely cause of this error would be incorrect data entry in the auth_WPM_date or auth_CAM_date fields. The expected values for these fields should be such that the WPM's authorization date is either the same or earlier than the CAM's authorization date. 

Please ensure that the dates entered in these fields are accurate to maintain the integrity and quality of the data in the DS08 WAD table.

This test is being performed to ensure that the Work Package Manager's (WPM) authorization date is not later than the Control Account Manager's (CAM) authorization date in the DS08 WAD table. The importance of this check is to maintain the correct sequence of authorizations in the project management process. If the WPM's authorization date is later than the CAM's, it could indicate a potential issue in the workflow or data entry error. 

The severity of this test is marked as an ALERT, which means it is not a critical error that would prevent the data from being reviewed, but it could potentially cause minor problems or indicate that the data does not follow all best practices. It is important to address this alert to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
