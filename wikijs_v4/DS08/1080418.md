## What causes this error?

> :robot: The following text was generated by an AI tool and hasn't been reviewed for accuracy by a human! It might be useful, but it also might have errors. Are you a human? You can help by reviewing it for accuracy! Edit it as needed then remove this message.
{.is-warning}

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Narrative Restates Title" is performed on the DS08 WAD table. This check is designed to ensure that the narrative field is not identical to the title field. 

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it means that the narrative and title fields in the DS08 WAD table contain the same information. This is not desirable as the narrative field should provide additional, unique information that complements the title, rather than simply restating it. 

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the DS08 WAD table and ensure that the narrative field provides distinct information from the title field. The narrative should not be a repetition of the title, but rather provide more context or detail about the entry.

This test is being performed to check if the narrative of the data is the same as the title in the DS08 WAD table. The purpose of this check is to ensure that the narrative accurately reflects the title, which is crucial for understanding and interpreting the data correctly. The severity of this check is marked as an ALERT, which means it's not a critical issue but it's still important to address. If the narrative restates the title, it might indicate redundancy or lack of detailed information, which could potentially cause minor problems in data analysis or interpretation. Therefore, this check is important to maintain the quality and integrity of the EVMS construction project management data.
