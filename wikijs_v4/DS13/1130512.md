The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Profit Fee Initial Dollars Missing" is designed to identify any instances in the DS13 Subcontract table where the 'profit_fee_initial_dollars' field is either missing or has a value of 0. 

This field is crucial as it represents the initial profit fee for a subcontract. If this field is missing or has a value of 0, it could indicate that the data was not entered correctly or was not captured at all during the data entry process. 

The expected value for the 'profit_fee_initial_dollars' field should be a positive number representing the initial profit fee for the subcontract. If the DIQ check identifies any records where this is not the case, these records should be reviewed and corrected to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data in the DS13 Subcontract table.
