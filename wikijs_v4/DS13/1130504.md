The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "BAC Initial Dollars Missing" is designed to identify any instances in the DS13 Subcontract table where the Budget at Completion (BAC) initial dollars are either missing or recorded as zero. 

The BAC initial dollars field is crucial for accurate project management as it represents the original budgeted cost of the work to be performed under a subcontract. If this field is missing or zero, it could indicate that the budget information was not entered correctly or not entered at all.

The DIQ check scans the DS13 Subcontract table and flags any records where the BAC initial dollars field is either null or zero. If the check returns any records, it means that there are subcontracts in the table that lack the necessary budget information. 

To resolve this issue, you should review the flagged records and ensure that the BAC initial dollars field is filled with the correct budgeted cost for each subcontract. If the budgeted cost is indeed zero, you should confirm that this is accurate and not a data entry error.

This test is being performed on the 'DS13 Subcontract' table to check if the 'BAC_initial_dollars' field is missing or has a value of 0. The 'BAC_initial_dollars' field is likely to represent the initial budgeted cost for the subcontract. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that all subcontracts have an initial budgeted cost assigned to them. If this field is missing or zero, it could lead to inaccuracies in financial tracking and budgeting, potentially causing problems during the analysis of the project's financial data. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'WARNING', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. Therefore, it is recommended to address this issue to ensure accurate and reliable project management data.
