The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "BL Start After BL Finish" is performed on the DS13 Subcontract table. This check is designed to identify any instances where the baseline start date (BL_start_date) is recorded as being after the baseline finish date (BL_finish_date). 

In a typical project management scenario, the baseline start date should always be earlier than or equal to the baseline finish date. Therefore, any records where the baseline start date is later than the baseline finish date would be flagged as an error by this DIQ check.

The likely cause of this error could be a data entry mistake where the start and finish dates were swapped or incorrectly inputted. To resolve this issue, you should review the flagged records and correct the dates as necessary, ensuring that the baseline start date is not later than the baseline finish date.

This test is being performed on the 'DS13 Subcontract' table to check if the baseline start date is after the baseline finish date. The test is important because it ensures the logical consistency of the project timeline. If the baseline start date is after the baseline finish date, it indicates a problem with the data entry or project planning, as logically a project cannot start after it has finished. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'WARNING', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. This could lead to incorrect conclusions or decisions based on the data. Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue to maintain the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data.
