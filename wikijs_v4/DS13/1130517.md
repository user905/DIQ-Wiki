The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Actual Finish After Actual Start" for the DS13 Subcontract table is designed to ensure that the actual start date of a subcontract is not later than its actual finish date. 

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it indicates that there are instances in the DS13 Subcontract table where the actual start date (AS_date) is later than the actual finish date (AF_date). This is an inconsistency as logically, the start date of any project or subcontract should always precede its finish date.

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the DS13 Subcontract table, specifically the fields for actual start date (AS_date) and actual finish date (AF_date). Ensure that the actual start date is not later than the actual finish date. If it is, correct the dates to reflect the accurate timeline of the subcontract.

This test is being performed to ensure that the actual start date of a task or project is not recorded as being after the actual finish date in the DS13 Subcontract table. This is a logical impossibility and indicates an error in data entry or recording. 

The importance of this check is to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the project timeline data. If the start and finish dates are incorrect, it could lead to misinterpretations about the project's duration, efficiency, and overall management. 

The severity of this issue is marked as a WARNING. This means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. For instance, it could skew calculations of average project duration or lead to incorrect conclusions about the order of tasks. Therefore, it is important to address this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
