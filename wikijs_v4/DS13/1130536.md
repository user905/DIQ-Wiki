The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Actuals Without Actual Start" is designed to identify any subcontracts in the DS13 Subcontract table that have actual cost of work performed (ACWP) but are missing an actual start date (AS_date). 

The error is likely to occur when a subcontract has recorded costs (ACWPc_dollars > 0) but does not have an associated actual start date (AS_date). This could be due to an oversight during data entry or a delay in updating the start date.

The fields causing the issue are the ACWPc_dollars and the AS_date. The ACWPc_dollars field should contain a positive value indicating that work has been performed and costs have been incurred. The AS_date field should contain the date when the actual work started. If the ACWPc_dollars field has a value greater than zero and the AS_date field is missing, this DIQ check will flag the record as an error.

To resolve this issue, ensure that all subcontracts with recorded costs also have an actual start date. This will improve the accuracy and completeness of the project management data.

This test is being performed on the 'DS13 Subcontract' table to check if there are any subcontracts with Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) that are missing an actual start date. The test is flagged as a WARNING, indicating that this issue could potentially cause problems during data analysis.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the project management data. In the context of Earned Value Management System (EVMS), both ACWP and the actual start date are crucial for tracking project performance and costs. If a subcontract has an actual cost but no actual start date, it could lead to inaccurate project tracking and financial discrepancies. Therefore, this check is necessary to maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.
