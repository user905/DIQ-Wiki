The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "FC Start After FC Finish" is performed on the DS13 Subcontract table. This check is designed to identify any instances where the forecasted start date (FC_start_date) is later than the forecasted finish date (FC_finish_date). 

In the context of project management, it is expected that the start date of any task or project should always precede its finish date. Therefore, if the DIQ check identifies any records where this is not the case, it indicates a potential data integrity issue.

The likely cause of this error could be a data entry mistake where the start and finish dates were inadvertently swapped. Alternatively, it could be due to a system error during data import or transfer. 

To resolve this issue, the forecasted start and finish dates for the identified records should be reviewed and corrected as necessary. The corrected data should have the forecasted start date earlier than or equal to the forecasted finish date.

This test is being performed on the 'DS13 Subcontract' table to check if the forecast start date (FC_start_date) is after the forecast finish date (FC_finish_date). The purpose of this test is to ensure that the data in these fields is logically consistent and accurate. 

The importance of this check lies in the fact that it is logically impossible for a project to start after it has already finished. Therefore, if the forecast start date is after the forecast finish date, it indicates a data entry error or a problem with the data source. This could potentially lead to incorrect analysis or decision-making based on this data.

The severity of this test is marked as 'WARNING', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
