The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Missing FC Start" is designed to identify any instances in the DS13 Subcontract table where the forecast start date (FC_start_date) is missing. 

The FC_start_date field is crucial for effective project management as it provides an estimate of when a particular subcontract is expected to commence. If this field is left blank, it could lead to scheduling conflicts, delays, or other project management issues.

The error message "FC_start_date missing" indicates that there are records in the DS13 Subcontract table where the FC_start_date field is not filled in. The expected value for this field would be a valid date indicating the forecasted start of the subcontract. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that all records in the DS13 Subcontract table have a valid date entered for the FC_start_date field.

This test is being performed on the 'DS13 Subcontract' table to check if the forecast start date (FC_start_date) is missing. The severity of this test is marked as 'WARNING', which implies that the absence of this data could potentially cause problems during the analysis of the project management data.

The importance of this check lies in the fact that the forecast start date is a crucial piece of information in project management. It provides an estimate of when a particular subcontracted task or project is expected to commence. Without this information, it could lead to inaccuracies in project scheduling, resource allocation, and overall project planning. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that this data is not missing to maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.
