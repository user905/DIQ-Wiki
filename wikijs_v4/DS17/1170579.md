## What causes this error?

> :robot: The following text was generated by an AI tool and hasn't been reviewed for accuracy by a human! It might be useful, but it also might have errors. Are you a human? You can help by reviewing it for accuracy! Edit it as needed then remove this message.

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check for the DS17 WBS EU table, titled "EU Minimum Dollars Greater Than Likely", is designed to ensure that the Estimated Ultimate (EU) minimum dollars are not greater than the likely dollars. 

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it means that the values in the 'EU_min_dollars' field are greater than the values in the 'EU_likely_dollars' field. This is not expected as the minimum estimate should logically be less than or equal to the likely estimate.

To resolve this issue, you should review the data entries in the 'EU_min_dollars' and 'EU_likely_dollars' fields. Ensure that the value for 'EU_min_dollars' is not greater than the value for 'EU_likely_dollars'. If it is, adjust the values accordingly to maintain data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed to ensure that the minimum estimated cost (EU_min_dollars) for a work breakdown structure element is not greater than the likely estimated cost (EU_likely_dollars). This is important because it would not make sense for the minimum cost to be higher than the likely cost. 

The severity of this test is marked as an ALERT, which means it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, but it could potentially cause minor problems or indicate that the data doesn't follow all best practices. It's important to address this issue to ensure accurate and logical cost estimations in the project management data.
