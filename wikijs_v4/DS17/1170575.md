The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "EU Likely Dollars Greater Than Max" is performed on the DS17 WBS EU table. This check is designed to ensure that the values in the 'EU_likely_dollars' field are not greater than the values in the 'EU_max_dollars' field.

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that there are instances where the estimated likely cost (EU_likely_dollars) of a work breakdown structure element exceeds the maximum estimated cost (EU_max_dollars). This discrepancy could be due to data entry errors or incorrect estimations.

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the 'EU_likely_dollars' and 'EU_max_dollars' fields. The 'EU_likely_dollars' should not exceed the 'EU_max_dollars'. Adjustments may need to be made to ensure that the likely cost estimates are within the maximum cost limits.

This test is being performed to check if the Estimated Ultimate (EU) likely dollars are greater than the maximum dollars in the DS17 WBS EU table. This is an important check because it ensures that the estimated cost of the project does not exceed the maximum budget allocated. 

The severity of this test is marked as an ALERT, which means it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, but it's still important to address. If the estimated cost is consistently higher than the maximum budget, it could indicate a problem with cost estimation or budgeting processes. It could also lead to minor problems during data analysis, as it might skew the results or lead to incorrect conclusions. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the data follows best practices and that the estimated cost does not exceed the maximum budget.
