The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WBS Missing in WBS Hierarchy" is designed to verify the consistency of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) identifiers in the DS17 WBS EU dataset. 

The test checks if there are any WBS identifiers (WBS_ID) in the DS17 WBS EU dataset that are not present in the DS01 WBS dataset. The WBS_ID is a unique identifier for each element in the Work Breakdown Structure, and it should be consistent across all datasets for accurate project management.

If this DIQ test fails, it indicates that there are inconsistencies in the WBS identifiers between the two datasets. This could be due to data entry errors, missing data, or updates in one dataset that have not been reflected in the other. 

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that all WBS identifiers in the DS17 WBS EU dataset are also present in the DS01 WBS dataset. Any missing or inconsistent WBS identifiers should be corrected or added as necessary.

This test is being performed to check if there are any Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) identifiers (WBS_ID) in the 'DS17 WBS EU' table that are not present in the WBS hierarchy (DS01.WBS_ID list). The Work Breakdown Structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that all WBS identifiers in the 'DS17 WBS EU' table are correctly mapped and included in the overall WBS hierarchy. If a WBS identifier is missing in the hierarchy, it could lead to mismanagement of tasks, incorrect allocation of resources, and potential delays in the project timeline. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'ALERT', which means it is less severe but still indicates that there might be minor problems or that the data doesn't follow all best practices. It's not a critical error, but it's something that should be addressed to maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.
