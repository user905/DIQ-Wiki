The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "EU Lacking Spread" is performed on the DS17 WBS EU table. This check is designed to ensure that there is a spread in the estimated cost values for each work breakdown structure element. 

The check is looking at three fields: EU_min_dollars, EU_likely_dollars, and EU_max_dollars. These fields represent the minimum, most likely, and maximum estimated costs for a work breakdown structure element. 

The DIQ check is flagging an issue if all three of these fields have the same value. This is because in project management, it is unusual for the minimum, most likely, and maximum estimates to be identical. There is typically some degree of uncertainty in these estimates, which is reflected in a spread of values.

If this DIQ check flags an issue, it is likely because the data entered into these fields does not reflect the expected spread of values. This could be due to a data entry error, or it could indicate that the estimates have not been properly calculated. 

To resolve this issue, review the estimated cost values for each work breakdown structure element. Ensure that these values reflect a realistic spread of potential costs, taking into account the inherent uncertainty in project cost estimation.

This test is being performed to check the spread of the Estimated Ultimate (EU) costs in the DS17 WBS EU table. The test is checking if the minimum, likely, and maximum dollar values for the EU are all equal. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that there is a realistic range of potential costs for the project. If all three values are equal, it suggests that there is no uncertainty or variability in the cost estimates, which is unlikely in a real-world project. This could potentially lead to problems in budgeting and financial planning for the project.

The severity of this test is marked as an ALERT. This means that while it's not a critical error that would prevent the data from being reviewed, it's still a potential issue that could cause minor problems or indicate that the data doesn't follow all best practices. It's a signal that the cost estimates might need to be reviewed for more realistic variability.
