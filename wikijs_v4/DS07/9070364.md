The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "EAC > BAC without OTB / OTS Date" is designed to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data in the DS07 IPMR Header and DS03 Cost tables. This check is specifically looking for instances where the Estimate at Completion (EAC) is greater than the Budget at Completion (BAC), but there is no Over Target Baseline (OTB) or Over Target Schedule (OTS) date provided.

The EAC is calculated as the sum of the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) and the Estimate to Complete (ETC) from the DS03 Cost table, plus the Undistributed Budget Estimate (UBE) from the DS07 IPMR Header table. The BAC is calculated as the sum of the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) from the DS03 Cost table, plus the Undistributed Budget Budget (UBB) from the DS07 IPMR Header table.

If the EAC is greater than the BAC, this indicates that the project is expected to cost more than the budgeted amount. In such cases, an OTB or OTS date should be provided to indicate when the project was re-baselined to account for the overage. If this date is missing or blank, it could indicate a data entry error or oversight.

To resolve this issue, review the relevant records in the DS07 IPMR Header and DS03 Cost tables. Ensure that all financial figures are accurate and that an OTB or OTS date is provided for any project where the EAC exceeds the BAC.

This test is being performed to ensure that the Estimated at Completion (EAC) is not greater than the Budget at Completion (BAC) without an Over Target Baseline (OTB) or Over Target Schedule (OTS) date. This is important because if the EAC is greater than the BAC, it indicates that the project is over budget. However, if there is no OTB or OTS date, it could mean that the project is not properly tracking its budget or schedule overruns.

The severity of this check is an ALERT, which means it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, but it could potentially cause minor problems or indicate that the data doesn't follow all best practices. For example, if this issue is not addressed, it could lead to inaccurate financial reporting or project management decisions based on incorrect budget or schedule data. Therefore, it's important to ensure that all projects have an OTB or OTS date if their EAC is greater than their BAC.
