The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Negative MR Budget" is designed to identify any instances where the Management Reserve (MR) budget is less than zero in the DS07 IPMR Header table. 

The MR budget should always be a positive value or zero, as it represents the amount of funds set aside for unforeseen project costs. A negative value would indicate an error in data entry or calculation. 

If this DIQ check identifies any records where the MR budget is less than zero, it will return those records for review. This allows for the identification and correction of any errors, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the project management data.

This test is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table to check if the Management Reserve (MR) budget is less than zero. The MR budget is a crucial component of project management as it is set aside to manage risks and unforeseen changes in a project. Having a negative MR budget could indicate a miscalculation or an error in data entry.

The severity of this test is marked as a 'WARNING', which means that while it may not immediately prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. For instance, a negative MR budget could lead to incorrect financial projections or risk assessments for the project.

Therefore, this check is important to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project's financial data. It helps in maintaining the integrity of the data and aids in making informed decisions regarding the project's risk management and financial planning.
