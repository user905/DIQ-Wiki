The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Zero Favorable Cost Inc Percent Threshold" is performed on the DS07 IPMR Header table. This check is designed to verify the integrity of the data in the 'threshold_cost_inc_pct_fav' field.

The purpose of this check is to ensure that the 'threshold_cost_inc_pct_fav' field is not equal to zero. This field represents the favorable cost increase percentage threshold. A value of zero in this field may indicate an error or omission in the data entry process, as it suggests that no favorable cost increase threshold has been set.

If the DIQ check identifies records where 'threshold_cost_inc_pct_fav' is equal to zero, it means that these records have not met the expected data quality standards. The expected value for this field should be a positive number representing the favorable cost increase percentage threshold for the project.

In the event of such an error, it is recommended to review the data entry process for the 'threshold_cost_inc_pct_fav' field to ensure that the correct values are being entered.

This test is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table to check if the favorable cost inc percent threshold is equal to zero. The test is currently in the 'TEST' status and has been flagged with an 'ALERT' severity. 

The purpose of this check is to ensure that the favorable cost increase percentage threshold is not set to zero. If it is, this could indicate a potential issue with the data input or a calculation error. This is important because a zero value could distort the analysis of the project's cost performance and potentially lead to incorrect conclusions or decisions.

The 'ALERT' severity indicates that this issue is not critical, but it might cause minor problems during data analysis or suggest that the data does not adhere to all best practices. Therefore, it is recommended to review and correct this issue to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project management data.
