The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Zero Unfavorable Cost VAC Percent Threshold" is designed to verify the integrity of data in the DS07 IPMR Header table. This check specifically focuses on the 'threshold_cost_VAC_pct_unfav' field.

The purpose of this check is to ensure that the unfavorable cost Variance at Completion (VAC) percent threshold is not equal to zero. The VAC percent threshold is a critical value in project management as it provides an indication of the cost performance of the project. A zero value in this field may indicate missing or incorrect data.

If the DIQ check returns a result, it means that there are records in the DS07 IPMR Header table where the 'threshold_cost_VAC_pct_unfav' field is either null or equal to zero. This is not expected, as the unfavorable cost VAC percent threshold should typically be a positive value.

To resolve this issue, you should review the data entry process for the 'threshold_cost_VAC_pct_unfav' field to ensure that it is being correctly populated. It may be necessary to correct the existing records in the DS07 IPMR Header table where the 'threshold_cost_VAC_pct_unfav' field is zero or null.

This test is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table to check if the unfavorable cost Variance at Completion (VAC) percent threshold is equal to zero. The Variance at Completion (VAC) is a forecast of what the variance, specifically the cost variance, will be upon the completion of the project. An unfavorable cost VAC indicates that the project is predicted to cost more than what was budgeted.

The severity of this test is marked as an 'ALERT', which means it's not a critical issue but it might cause minor problems or indicate that the data doesn't follow all best practices. If the unfavorable cost VAC percent threshold is indeed zero, it could mean that there is no buffer for cost overruns, which is not a good practice in project management. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that there is a realistic expectation of potential cost overruns in the project. If the threshold is zero, it could lead to unrealistic budgeting and planning, and potential issues in project completion. It's crucial to have some margin for cost overruns to ensure smooth project execution and completion.
