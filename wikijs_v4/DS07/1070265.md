The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Negative or Zero PM EAC Best Dollars" is designed to identify any instances where the PM EAC Best dollars value is zero or negative in the DS07 IPMR Header table. 

The PM EAC Best dollars field should ideally contain positive values, as it represents the best estimate at completion in dollars for the project management. A zero or negative value in this field could indicate an error in data entry or calculation.

If this DIQ check identifies any records with a zero or negative PM EAC Best dollars value, it suggests that there may be inaccuracies in the project management's financial estimates. These inaccuracies could potentially impact the overall project budget and timeline, and should therefore be corrected as soon as possible. 

To resolve this issue, review the data entries for the PM EAC Best dollars field in the DS07 IPMR Header table. Ensure that all values are positive and accurately reflect the project management's best estimate at completion in dollars.

The severity of this test is marked as a 'WARNING', which means that if the 'PM EAC Best dollars' value is found to be zero or negative, it could potentially cause problems during the analysis of the data. This could be due to incorrect data entry, calculation errors, or other issues that might distort the true cost picture of the project.

The importance of this check is to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project cost data.
