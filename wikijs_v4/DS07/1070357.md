The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Low Cost QRA" is performed on the DS07 IPMR Header table. This check is designed to identify instances where the Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) confidence level for cost is less than 70%. 

The QRA confidence level for cost is represented by the field 'QRA_CL_cost_pct'. If the value in this field is less than 0.7 (or 70%), the DIQ check will flag it as an issue. 

The likely cause of this error is an incorrect or low confidence level entry in the 'QRA_CL_cost_pct' field. The expected value for this field should be 0.7 or higher, indicating a 70% or greater confidence level in the cost analysis. 

If the DIQ check identifies records with a 'QRA_CL_cost_pct' value less than 0.7, it suggests that the cost risk analysis for those records may not be reliable or accurate. It is recommended to review these records and update the 'QRA_CL_cost_pct' field with the correct confidence level, if necessary.

This test is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table to check the quantitative risk analysis (QRA) confidence level for cost. The test is checking if the confidence level is less than 70%. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the risk analysis for cost is reliable and has a high confidence level. 

The importance of this check is to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the cost data. If the confidence level is less than 70%, it indicates that the cost data may not be reliable, which could lead to inaccurate cost projections and financial risks for the project. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'WARNING', which means that if the confidence level is less than 70%, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis of the data. It is not an immediate error that would prevent the data from being reviewed, but it is a significant issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the integrity and quality of the data.
