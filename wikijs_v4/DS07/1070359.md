Test Title: Low Schedule QRA

This Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check is performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table. The purpose of this test is to identify if the Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) confidence level for the schedule is less than 70%. 

The QRA confidence level is a measure of the certainty that the project will be completed within the defined schedule. A value below 70% indicates a high level of risk associated with the project schedule, which may be due to various factors such as unrealistic timeframes, resource constraints, or unforeseen complications.

The field causing the issue in this test is 'QRA_CL_Schedule_pct'. If the value in this field is less than 0.7 (or 70%), the test will flag it as an error. 

The expected value for 'QRA_CL_Schedule_pct' should be equal to or greater than 0.7. This would indicate a satisfactory level of confidence in the project schedule. If the value is below this threshold, it may be necessary to review and adjust the project schedule or risk management strategies to ensure project success.

This test is being performed on the 'DS07 IPMR Header' table to check the quantitative risk analysis (QRA) confidence level for the schedule. The test is checking if the QRA confidence level for the schedule is less than 70%. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the risk analysis for the schedule is robust and reliable. A QRA confidence level of less than 70% could indicate that there are significant risks associated with the schedule that have not been adequately addressed or mitigated. This could potentially lead to delays or other issues in the project management process.

The severity of this check is marked as 'WARNING', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. It is therefore important to address this issue to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project management data.
