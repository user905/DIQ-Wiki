The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Resource Performance without Cost Actuals" is designed to identify any discrepancies between the recorded resource performance and the actual costs in the DS06 Resources and DS03 Cost tables respectively. 

The test is specifically looking for instances where the resource performance (actual dollars) is greater than zero, but the actual cost (ACWPc) is not recorded or is zero. This discrepancy could be due to a variety of reasons such as data entry errors, system glitches, or missing data.

The fields causing the issue are the 'actual_dollars' field in the DS06 Resources table and the 'ACWPi_dollars' field in the DS03 Cost table. The expected values for these fields should be consistent with each other. That is, if the 'actual_dollars' field in the DS06 Resources table is greater than zero, then the 'ACWPi_dollars' field in the DS03 Cost table should also be greater than zero.

If this DIQ check identifies any discrepancies, it is recommended to review the data entry process for these fields and ensure that all data is being accurately recorded and updated.

This test is being performed to ensure that there is no discrepancy between the recorded resource performance and the actual costs recorded in the DS06 Resources table. Specifically, it checks if there is any resource performance recorded (actual_dollars > 0) even though no actual costs (DS03.ACWPc = 0) have been recorded by the end of the contract (EOC). 

The importance of this check lies in maintaining the accuracy and consistency of the data. If a resource has recorded performance, it should logically have some associated costs. If no costs are recorded, it could indicate a data entry error or a problem with the cost tracking system. 

The severity of this check is marked as an ALERT, which means it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed. However, it's still important to address as it could potentially cause minor problems in the data analysis or indicate that the data doesn't fully adhere to best practices.
