The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Resource without Budget" is designed to identify any resources in the DS06 Resources table that lack budget information. This could be either in terms of budget dollars or budget units.

The error message "Resource found without budget (budget_dollars and/or budget_units = 0)" indicates that there are resources in the DS06 Resources table that have either no budget dollars allocated or no budget units assigned. This could be due to an oversight during data entry or a mistake in the data import process.

The fields causing the issue are 'budget_dollars' and 'budget_units'. The expected values for these fields should be greater than zero, as a resource should have some budget allocated to it in terms of dollars and units. 

To resolve this issue, review the resources in the DS06 Resources table and ensure that each resource has appropriate budget dollars and units assigned. If a resource is found with zero budget dollars or units, it should be updated with the correct budget information.

This test is being performed on the 'DS06 Resources' table to check if there are any resources that do not have budget dollars and/or units allocated to them. The test is looking for instances where the 'budget_dollars' and/or 'budget_units' fields are equal to zero, indicating that no budget has been assigned to a particular resource.

The importance of this check is to ensure that all resources involved in the EVMS construction project have been properly budgeted for. If a resource does not have a budget, it could lead to oversights in financial planning and potentially disrupt the project's progress. 

The severity of this test is marked as an 'ALERT', which is less severe. This means that while it's not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, it's still a potential problem that should be addressed. It could indicate minor problems in the data or suggest that the data does not fully adhere to best practices for project management.
