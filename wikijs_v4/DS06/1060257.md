The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Labor Resource with Non-Hour UOM Type" is designed to ensure that all labor-type resources in the DS06 Resources table are measured in hours. 

The test checks for any instances where a labor-type resource has a unit of measure (UOM) that is not hours ('h'). If such instances are found, it indicates a mismatch between the resource type and its unit of measure. 

The error is likely to be caused by incorrect data entry in the 'type' and 'UOM' fields of the DS06 Resources table. For example, a labor-type resource might have been incorrectly assigned a non-hour unit of measure such as 'days' or 'weeks'. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that all labor-type resources in the DS06 Resources table have 'h' as their unit of measure. This will ensure consistency and accuracy in the representation and calculation of labor resources.

This test is being performed to ensure that all labor-type resources in the 'DS06 Resources' table are using the correct unit of measure (UOM), which should be hours (h). The test is checking for any instances where the UOM for labor is not hours, which could lead to inaccuracies in labor cost calculations and resource allocation.

The importance of this check lies in maintaining the consistency and accuracy of the data. In project management, labor resources are typically measured in hours, and using a different UOM could lead to misinterpretations or errors in data analysis. This could further impact project scheduling, budgeting, and overall management.

The severity level is marked as 'WARNING', which means that while this issue may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. Therefore, it is recommended to address this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the data.
