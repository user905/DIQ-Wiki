The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Resource Remaining Dollars Misaligned with Cost BCWR" is designed to ensure that the sum of resource remaining dollars, when rolled up into the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in DS04, aligns with the Budgeted Cost of Work Remaining (BCWR) in DS03. This alignment is checked for each WBS ID and Estimate at Completion (EOC).

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it indicates that there is a discrepancy between the remaining resource dollars and the BCWR for a specific WBS ID and EOC. This could be due to incorrect data entry in either DS06 Resources or DS03 Cost. 

In DS06 Resources, the fields that could be causing the issue are 'task_ID', 'EOC', and 'remaining_dollars'. The 'remaining_dollars' field should accurately reflect the remaining dollars for each task and EOC. 

In DS03 Cost, the fields that could be causing the issue are 'WBS_ID_WP', 'EOC', 'BCWSi_dollars', and 'BCWPi_dollars'. The BCWR is calculated as the difference between 'BCWSi_dollars' and 'BCWPi_dollars' for each WBS ID and EOC. 

To resolve the issue, review the data entries in these fields and ensure that they accurately reflect the remaining resource dollars and the BCWR for each WBS ID and EOC.

This test is being performed to ensure that the remaining resource dollars, when rolled up to the schedule Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), align with the Budgeted Cost of Work Remaining (BCWR) in the cost data. The test is checking for any discrepancies between the sum of remaining resource dollars and the BCWR by WBS_ID and End of Contract (EOC).

The importance of this check lies in maintaining the accuracy and consistency of financial data within the project. Misalignment between these two figures could indicate errors in budgeting, resource allocation, or financial reporting, which could potentially lead to financial mismanagement or inaccurate project forecasting. 

The severity of this check is marked as an ALERT, which means it's not critical but could cause minor problems or indicate that the data doesn't follow all best practices. It's a signal to review the data and correct any potential issues to ensure the integrity and quality of the project's financial data.
