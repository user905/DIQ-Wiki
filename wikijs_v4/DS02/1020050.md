The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Parent OBS ID Missing In OBS List" is designed to verify the consistency of the Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS) in the DS02 OBS table. 

The test checks if there are any instances where the Parent OBS ID does not exist in the list of OBS IDs. This could occur if a record was deleted from the OBS ID list but still referenced as a parent in another record, or if there was an error during data entry.

The fields involved in this check are the Parent OBS ID and the OBS ID. The expected value is that every Parent OBS ID should also exist in the OBS ID list. If a Parent OBS ID is not found in the OBS ID list, an error message "Parent OBS ID not found in the OBS ID list" will be generated. 

To maintain data integrity, it is important to ensure that all Parent OBS IDs are correctly referenced in the OBS ID list. Any discrepancies should be investigated and corrected promptly.

This test is being performed to ensure that every Parent OBS (Organizational Breakdown Structure) ID in the DS02 OBS table is also present in the OBS ID list. The OBS is a hierarchical, tree-structured view of a project's organization, and each element in the OBS can have a unique ID. The Parent OBS ID refers to the ID of the parent element in this hierarchy. 

The importance of this check is to maintain the integrity of the hierarchical structure of the project's organization. If a Parent OBS ID is missing from the OBS ID list, it means there is a break in the hierarchy, which could lead to confusion and errors in project management and reporting. 

The severity of this check is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if a Parent OBS ID is missing, it is a critical issue that must be fixed before the data can be reviewed or used for further analysis. This is because the integrity and accuracy of the project's organizational structure are crucial for effective project management and control.
