## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "OBS ID Not Unique" is designed to ensure that each Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS) ID in the DS02 OBS table is unique across the OBS hierarchy. 

The error message "OBS ID is not unique across the OBS hierarchy" indicates that there are duplicate OBS IDs present in the DS02 OBS table. This is likely caused by data entry errors or system issues that have allowed the same OBS ID to be used for more than one entry in the OBS hierarchy.

The field causing the issue is the OBS_ID field. The expected value for each entry in this field is a unique identifier that is not repeated elsewhere in the OBS hierarchy. 

To resolve this issue, each OBS ID should be reviewed and corrected as necessary to ensure uniqueness across the OBS hierarchy. This may involve correcting data entry errors or addressing system issues that have allowed duplicate OBS IDs to be created.

This test is being performed to ensure that the Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS) ID is unique across the OBS hierarchy in the DS02 OBS table. The OBS ID is a critical identifier used to organize and manage different parts of the project, and if it is not unique, it could lead to confusion, misinterpretation of data, and errors in project management and reporting.

The severity of this test is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if the OBS ID is not unique, it is a critical issue that must be fixed before the data can be reviewed or used for further analysis. This check is important because it ensures the integrity and reliability of the project management data. Without unique OBS IDs, it would be impossible to accurately track and manage different aspects of the project, which could lead to significant issues in project execution and reporting.

(
    -- Insert statements for procedure here
	SELECT 
		* 
	FROM 
		DS02_OBS 
	WHERE 
			upload_ID = @upload_ID
		AND OBS_ID IN (
			SELECT OBS_ID 
			FROM DS02_OBS 
			WHERE upload_ID = @upload_ID 
			GROUP BY OBS_ID 
			HAVING COUNT(OBS_ID) > 1
