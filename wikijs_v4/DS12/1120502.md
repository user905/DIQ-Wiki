The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Duplicate VAR CAL Entry" is designed to identify any duplicate entries in the DS12 Variance CAL table. This check specifically looks for any instances where the combination of CAL_ID and transaction_ID is repeated more than once in the table.

If the DIQ check returns a positive result, it indicates that there are duplicate entries in the DS12 Variance CAL table. This is likely due to an error in data entry or data import, where the same variance calculation (VAR CAL) has been recorded multiple times with the same CAL_ID and transaction_ID.

The fields causing this issue are the CAL_ID and transaction_ID fields. The expected values for these fields are unique combinations of CAL_ID and transaction_ID for each entry in the DS12 Variance CAL table. If the same combination appears more than once, it is considered a duplicate and flagged by this DIQ check.

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the DS12 Variance CAL table and remove or correct any duplicate entries. Ensure that each VAR CAL entry has a unique combination of CAL_ID and transaction_ID.

This test, titled 'Duplicate VAR CAL Entry', is being performed on the 'DS12 Variance CAL' table to check for any duplicate entries in the data. The test is specifically looking for instances where the combination of 'CAL_ID' and 'transaction_ID' appears more than once in the data. 

The importance of this check lies in maintaining the uniqueness of each entry in the data. Duplicate entries can lead to incorrect calculations, skewed results, and misleading insights during data analysis. It can also cause issues in data management and processing, as it can be unclear which of the duplicate entries should be used or retained.

The severity of this test is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if any duplicate entries are found, they must be addressed and resolved before the data can be reviewed. Ignoring this error could lead to significant problems in the data analysis and interpretation stages of the project.
