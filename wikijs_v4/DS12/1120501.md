Test Name: Transaction ID Missing

Table: DS12 Variance CAL

Summary: This test checks if the transaction ID is missing in the DS12 Variance CAL table.

Explanation: The Transaction ID Missing test is designed to ensure that every record in the DS12 Variance CAL table has a valid transaction ID. The transaction ID is a critical field that uniquely identifies each transaction. If this field is missing or blank, it could lead to issues with data tracking and reporting.

Error Message: "transaction_ID blank or missing."

Potential Cause: This error is likely to occur if the transaction ID field is not properly populated during data entry or import. This could be due to a mistake in the data entry process, or an issue with the source data.

Expected Values: The transaction ID field should contain a unique identifier for each transaction. It should not be blank or missing. Please ensure that this field is correctly populated for all records in the DS12 Variance CAL table.

This test is being performed on the 'DS12 Variance CAL' table to check if there are any instances where the transaction ID is missing or blank. The transaction ID is a crucial piece of information that uniquely identifies each transaction, and its absence can lead to difficulties in tracking, referencing, and analyzing individual transactions.

The severity of this test is marked as 'WARNING', which implies that while it may not completely halt the review of data, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. This is because without a unique identifier like a transaction ID, it becomes challenging to distinguish between different transactions, trace them back to their source, or perform any meaningful analysis on them.

Therefore, this check is important to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the data, and to facilitate efficient and effective data analysis. It helps in maintaining the integrity of the data by ensuring that each transaction can be individually identified and tracked.
