Test Title: Original Due Date After Forecast Due Date

Test Summary: This test checks if the original due date for a corrective action is set after the forecast due date in the DS12 Variance CAL table.

Error Message: Original Due Date is greater than Forecast Due Date.

Explanation: This error is likely to occur when the original due date for a corrective action is incorrectly entered as a date that is later than the forecast due date. The fields causing this issue are 'original_due_date' and 'forecast_due_date'. 

The 'original_due_date' should ideally be a date that is earlier than or equal to the 'forecast_due_date'. If the 'original_due_date' is later than the 'forecast_due_date', it implies that the corrective action is planned to be completed after it was initially forecasted, which is a discrepancy. 

To resolve this issue, please review and correct the dates in the 'original_due_date' and 'forecast_due_date' fields as necessary. Ensure that the 'original_due_date' is not set to a date later than the 'forecast_due_date'.

This test is being performed on the 'DS12 Variance CAL' table to check if the original due date for a corrective action is after the forecast due date. The severity level is 'WARNING', which implies that this issue could potentially cause problems during data analysis if not addressed.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of project scheduling and management. If the original due date is after the forecast due date, it could indicate a problem with the project planning or execution, such as delays or misestimations. This could potentially lead to inaccurate forecasting, project overruns, and inefficient resource allocation. Therefore, this check is crucial for maintaining the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data.
