The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Approved Date After Implementation Date" is designed to ensure that the approved date for a change is not later than the implementation date of the change. This check is performed on the DS09 CC Log table.

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it indicates that there are entries in the DS09 CC Log table where the approved date is later than the implementation date. This is likely due to a data entry error, as logically, a change cannot be implemented before it is approved.

The fields causing the issue are the 'approved_date' and 'implementation_date' fields. The expected values for these fields should be such that the 'approved_date' is either the same as or earlier than the 'implementation_date'. 

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the DS09 CC Log table and correct any instances where the approved date is later than the implementation date.

This test is being performed on the 'DS09 CC Log' table to check if the approved date of a change order is later than the implementation date. The severity level is 'WARNING', which means that if this issue is not addressed, it could potentially cause problems during data analysis.

The importance of this check lies in maintaining the chronological accuracy of the project management data. In a typical workflow, a change order should be approved before it is implemented. If the approved date is later than the implementation date, it could indicate a problem in the data recording process or a violation of standard procedures. This could lead to incorrect interpretations or decisions based on the data. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the approved date is not later than the implementation date to maintain the integrity and quality of the data.
