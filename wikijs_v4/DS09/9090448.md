The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Risk Missing in Risk Register" is designed to ensure that all risk IDs listed in the DS09 CC Log are also present in the DS15 Risk Register. 

If a risk ID is found in the DS09 CC Log but not in the DS15 Risk Register, this check will flag an error. This discrepancy could be due to a number of reasons such as a data entry error, a missing entry in the DS15 Risk Register, or a misalignment between the two datasets.

The fields causing the issue in this case are the 'risk_ID' fields in both the DS09 CC Log and the DS15 Risk Register. The expected values for the 'risk_ID' field in the DS09 CC Log should match those in the DS15 Risk Register. 

If this DIQ check flags an error, it is recommended to cross-verify the 'risk_ID' entries in both datasets and ensure they are aligned. Any missing or incorrect 'risk_ID' entries in the DS15 Risk Register should be corrected to resolve the issue.

This test is being performed to ensure that all risk IDs listed in the 'DS09 CC Log' table are also present in the 'DS15.risk_ID' list, which is the risk register. The risk register is a crucial document in project management as it contains details about all identified risks, including their nature, impacts, and the actions to be taken to mitigate them. 

The importance of this check is to maintain data integrity and consistency across different data sources. If a risk ID is mentioned in the 'DS09 CC Log' table but is missing from the risk register, it could lead to incomplete risk analysis and management, potentially causing project delays or cost overruns. 

The severity of this issue is marked as 'ALERT', which means it's not critical but could cause minor problems. It's a good practice to ensure all risks are properly registered and tracked across all relevant data sources.
