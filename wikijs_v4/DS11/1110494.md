The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Root Cause And/Or Impact Narrative Missing" is performed on the DS11 Variance table. This check is designed to identify any Variance Analysis Reports (VARs) that are missing either a root cause narrative or an impact narrative, or both.

The root cause narrative fields that are checked include the Cost Variance (CV) and Schedule Variance (SV) narratives, both in terms of cost and impact. These fields are identified as 'narrative_RC_CVc', 'narrative_RC_CVi', 'narrative_RC_SVc', and 'narrative_RC_SVi' in the database. If any of these fields are empty, the VAR is flagged as missing a root cause narrative.

The impact narrative fields that are checked include cost, schedule, and technical impact narratives. These fields are identified as 'narrative_impact_cost', 'narrative_impact_schedule', and 'narrative_impact_technical' in the database. If any of these fields are empty, the VAR is flagged as missing an impact narrative.

If a VAR is missing either a root cause or an impact narrative, it indicates that the VAR is incomplete and may not provide a full understanding of the variance. This could be due to an oversight during data entry or a lack of information at the time of entry. The expected values for these fields are narrative descriptions of the root cause and impact of the variance.

This test is being performed on the 'DS11 Variance' table to check if there are any Variance Analysis Reports (VARs) that are missing either a root cause or an impact narrative, or both. The root cause narrative should explain the source of the variance, while the impact narrative should describe the potential effects of the variance on the project. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that all necessary information is included in the VARs. Without a complete understanding of the cause and potential impact of a variance, it may be difficult to make informed decisions about how to address it. This could lead to ineffective management of the project, potentially causing delays or cost overruns. 

The severity of this check is classified as a 'WARNING', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. Therefore, it is important to address this issue to ensure the quality and integrity of the project management data.
