The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check for the DS11 Variance table, titled "Cost Variance Root Cause Narrative Missing Impact", is designed to identify instances where a cost variance root cause narrative is present, but an accompanying impact statement is missing. 

This issue arises when either the 'narrative_RC_CVi' or 'narrative_RC_CVc' fields contain data, indicating that a root cause narrative for cost variance has been provided, but the 'narrative_impact_cost' field is either blank or missing. The 'narrative_impact_cost' field is expected to contain a statement detailing the impact of the cost variance, providing context and understanding to the root cause narrative.

To resolve this issue, ensure that every entry in the 'narrative_RC_CVi' or 'narrative_RC_CVc' fields is accompanied by a corresponding impact statement in the 'narrative_impact_cost' field. This will ensure the completeness and integrity of the cost variance data in the DS11 Variance table.

This test is being performed on the 'DS11 Variance' table to check if there are any instances where a cost variance root cause narrative is present, but an impact statement is missing. The test is looking for instances where either 'narrative_RC_CVi' or 'narrative_RC_CVc' is found, but 'narrative_impact_cost' is blank or missing. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that all cost variance root cause narratives are accompanied by an impact statement. This is crucial for understanding the implications of the cost variance and for making informed decisions based on the data. Without an impact statement, the root cause narrative is incomplete and may not provide a full picture of the situation.

The severity of this check is classified as an 'ALERT'. This means that while it is not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed, it is still a potential problem that could cause minor issues during analysis. It also indicates that the data does not fully adhere to best practices, as all cost variance root cause narratives should ideally be accompanied by an impact statement.
