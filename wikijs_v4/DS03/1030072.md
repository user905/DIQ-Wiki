The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WP or PP with Multiple EVT Groups" is designed to ensure that each Work Package (WP) or Planning Package (PP) in the DS03 Cost table is associated with a single, uniform EVT group. 

EVT groups categorize the type of effort involved in a WP or PP. They can be 'Discrete', 'LOE' (Level of Effort), 'Apportioned', or 'PP' (Planning Package). The DIQ check identifies any WP or PP where the EVT group is not uniform, meaning that the associated EVTs are not all of the same type.

The fields involved in this check are 'WBS_ID_WP' and 'EVT'. The 'WBS_ID_WP' field identifies the WP or PP, and the 'EVT' field indicates the type of effort. 

If the DIQ check fails, it means that a WP or PP has been associated with more than one type of EVT. This could be due to a data entry error or a misunderstanding of the EVT categorization system. 

To resolve this issue, review the EVT assignments for each WP or PP in the DS03 Cost table. Ensure that each WP or PP is associated with a single, uniform EVT group.

This test is being performed on the 'DS03 Cost' table to check for Work Packages (WP) or Planning Packages (PP) that have more than one Earned Value Technique (EVT) group. The test is checking for uniformity in the EVT group, meaning all EVTs should be either LOE (Level of Effort), Discrete, Apportioned, or Planning Package for this particular WP or PP data.

The severity of this test is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if this issue is not resolved, the data cannot be reviewed or analyzed further. 

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the consistency and accuracy of the data. Having multiple EVT groups for a single WP or PP can lead to confusion and inaccuracies during data analysis. It could potentially distort the understanding of the project's cost performance and progress, leading to incorrect decision-making. Therefore, it is crucial to fix this error to maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.
