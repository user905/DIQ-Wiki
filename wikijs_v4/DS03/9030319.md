The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "SV Percent without Root Cause Narrative (Unfavorable)" is designed to identify any instances in the DS03 Cost table where a root cause narrative is missing for a cost account (CA) that has a Schedule Variance (SV) percentage exceeding the unfavorable threshold. 

The SV percentage is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) and the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS), divided by BCWS. This is compared to the unfavorable threshold value from the DS07 IPMR Header table. 

The check is looking for instances where the SV percentage is greater than the unfavorable threshold and the root cause narrative for the SV (narrative_RC_SVc) in the DS11 Variance table is either missing or blank. The check is performed by grouping the data by the Cost Account Work Breakdown Structure ID (WBS_ID_CA).

If this DIQ check fails, it is likely due to missing or blank entries in the narrative_RC_SVc field in the DS11 Variance table for cost accounts with a high SV percentage. To resolve this issue, ensure that a root cause narrative is provided for all cost accounts where the SV percentage exceeds the unfavorable threshold.

This test is being performed to ensure that there is a root cause narrative provided for any cost account (CA) where the Schedule Variance (SV) percent exceeds the unfavorable percent threshold. The Schedule Variance percent is calculated as the absolute difference between the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) and the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS), divided by BCWS. If this value is greater than the unfavorable threshold and there is no root cause narrative provided, a warning is issued.

The importance of this check is to ensure that any significant deviations from the planned schedule are properly documented and explained. This is crucial for understanding the reasons behind any unfavorable variances and for making informed decisions about how to address them. Without this information, it would be difficult to identify and address the root causes of schedule slippages, which could lead to further delays and cost overruns. The severity of this check is classified as a warning, indicating that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it could cause problems during analysis if not addressed.
