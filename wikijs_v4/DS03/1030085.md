The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled '100-0 EVT' is performed on the 'DS03 Cost' table. This check is designed to identify if the work uses a 100-0 Earned Value Technique (EVT). 

The error message '100-0 EVT (EVT = G) used (This is not recommended)' indicates that the EVT field in the 'DS03 Cost' table contains the value 'G'. This value is not recommended for use in the EVT field as it signifies a 100-0 EVT, which may not accurately reflect the progress of work.

The expected value for the EVT field should not be 'G'. It is recommended to use other EVT methods that provide a more accurate representation of the work progress. Please review the data entered in the EVT field of the 'DS03 Cost' table and correct it if necessary.

This test is being performed to check if the work in the 'DS03 Cost' table is using a 100-0 Earned Value Technique (EVT). The 100-0 EVT, indicated by 'EVT = G', is a method where 100% of the value is claimed at the start of the work and 0% at the completion. This method is not recommended as it can lead to inaccuracies in tracking progress and cost performance.

The severity of this test is marked as an 'ALERT', which is less severe but indicates that there might be minor problems or that the data doesn't follow all best practices. The use of 100-0 EVT might not cause immediate issues, but it could potentially lead to problems in the future, such as inaccurate forecasting or budgeting.

The importance of this check is to ensure that the project management data follows best practices for tracking progress and cost performance. By avoiding the use of 100-0 EVT, the Department of Energy can ensure more accurate and reliable data for managing their construction projects.
