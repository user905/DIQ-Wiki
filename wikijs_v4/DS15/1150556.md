The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Probability Schedule Min Equal To Or Above 98%" is performed on the DS15 Risk Register. This check is designed to ensure that the minimum probability schedule percent is equal to or above 98%. 

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that there are entries in the Risk Register where the minimum probability schedule percent is less than 98%. This could be due to data entry errors or incorrect calculations. 

The field causing the issue is 'probability_schedule_min_pct'. The expected value for this field is a percentage equal to or above 98%. Any value below this threshold will cause the DIQ check to fail. 

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the Risk Register and correct any that have a 'probability_schedule_min_pct' value below 98%.

This test is being performed on the 'DS15 Risk Register' table to ensure that the minimum probability schedule percent is equal to or above 98%. The purpose of this check is to ensure that the risk management data is realistic and reliable. If the minimum probability schedule percent is less than 98%, it could indicate that the risk assessments are overly optimistic, which could lead to underestimation of project risks and potential project delays or cost overruns.

The severity of this check is marked as 'WARNING', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it could cause problems during analysis. For instance, if the minimum probability schedule percent is too low, it could skew the risk analysis results and lead to incorrect decision-making. Therefore, it's important to address this issue to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project risk management data.
