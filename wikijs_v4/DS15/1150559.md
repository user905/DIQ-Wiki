The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Risk Duplicated" is designed to identify any potential duplication of risk entries in the DS15 Risk Register. This check specifically looks for instances where the combination of 'risk_ID' and 'revision' fields appear more than once in the data set.

If the DIQ check returns a positive result, it indicates that there are duplicate entries in the DS15 Risk Register. This duplication could be due to a data entry error or a system glitch that has resulted in the same risk being recorded multiple times with the same 'risk_ID' and 'revision' values.

The expected values for the 'risk_ID' and 'revision' fields should be unique for each risk entry. If the same combination of 'risk_ID' and 'revision' appears more than once, it suggests that the same risk has been recorded multiple times, which could lead to inaccurate risk assessment and management.

To resolve this issue, it is recommended to review the DS15 Risk Register for any duplicate entries and correct them as necessary. This will ensure the accuracy and integrity of the risk management data.

This test is being performed on the 'DS15 Risk Register' table to check for any duplicated risks. The test is looking for instances where the combination of 'risk_ID' and 'revision' appears more than once, which would indicate a duplicated risk. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if any duplicated risks are found, they must be addressed and corrected before the data can be reviewed. 

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data. Duplicated risks can lead to incorrect analysis and decision-making, as they can artificially inflate the perceived level of risk. By identifying and correcting these errors, we can ensure that the data accurately reflects the true risk landscape of the EVMS construction project.
