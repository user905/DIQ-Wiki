## What causes this error?

> :robot: The following text was generated by an AI tool and hasn't been reviewed for accuracy by a human! It might be useful, but it also might have errors. Are you a human? You can help by reviewing it for accuracy! Edit it as needed then remove this message.

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Probability Cost Min % Greater Than Max %" is performed on the DS15 Risk Register data. This check is designed to ensure that the minimum probability cost percentage is not greater than the maximum probability cost percentage. 

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it indicates that there are entries in the data where the minimum probability cost percentage (probability_cost_min_pct) is incorrectly recorded as being higher than the maximum probability cost percentage (probability_cost_max_pct). 

This discrepancy could be due to a data entry error or a calculation error. The expected values for these fields should be such that the minimum probability cost percentage is less than or equal to the maximum probability cost percentage. 

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the DS15 Risk Register data and correct any instances where the minimum probability cost percentage is greater than the maximum. This will ensure the integrity and quality of the data in the DS15 Risk Register.

This test is being performed on the 'DS15 Risk Register' table to check if the minimum probability cost percent is greater than the maximum percent. This is an important check because in normal circumstances, the minimum value should not be greater than the maximum value. If this is the case, it could indicate an error in data entry or calculation, which could lead to incorrect risk assessment and management decisions.

The severity of this test is marked as 'ALERT', which is less severe than 'WARNING' or 'ERROR'. This means that while this issue might not prevent the data from being reviewed, it could potentially cause minor problems during analysis or indicate that the data does not follow all best practices. Therefore, it is recommended to address this issue to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the project management data.
