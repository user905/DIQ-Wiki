## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Opportunity With Avoid Or Transfer Handling Type" is designed to validate the data in the DS15 Risk Register. Specifically, it checks whether an opportunity (type 'O') has a risk handling type of either 'avoid' or 'transfer'. 

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it indicates that there is an opportunity in the DS15 Risk Register that does not have a risk handling type of 'avoid' or 'transfer'. This could be due to a data entry error or a system error when the data was imported or updated. 

The fields causing the issue are 'type' and 'risk_handling'. The 'type' field should contain the value 'O' to indicate an opportunity, and the 'risk_handling' field should contain either 'avoid' or 'transfer'. Any other values in these fields will cause this DIQ check to fail. 

To resolve this issue, review the data in the DS15 Risk Register and ensure that all opportunities have a risk handling type of either 'avoid' or 'transfer'.

This test is being performed on the 'DS15 Risk Register' table to check if there are any opportunities that have an 'Avoid' or 'Transfer' handling type. The purpose of this check is to ensure that the data related to risk handling is correctly categorized and recorded. 

The importance of this check lies in the fact that it helps in maintaining the accuracy and consistency of the risk management data. It ensures that the opportunities are not incorrectly marked as 'Avoid' or 'Transfer', which could potentially lead to misinterpretation of the data and incorrect decision-making. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'ALERT', which means it is of less severity. However, it indicates that there might be minor problems or that the data doesn't follow all best practices. Therefore, while it may not stop the data from being reviewed, it is still important to address this issue to ensure the overall quality and integrity of the data.
