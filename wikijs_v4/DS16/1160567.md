## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Minimum Impact Schedule Days Greater Than Likely Days" is performed on the DS16 Risk Register Tasks dataset. This check is designed to ensure that the minimum impact days for a schedule are not greater than the likely impact days. 

If this DIQ check fails, it indicates that there are instances in the data where the 'impact_schedule_minimum_days' field is greater than the 'impact_schedule_likely_days' field. This is not expected as the minimum impact days should logically be less than or equal to the likely impact days. 

The error is likely caused by incorrect data entry or calculation in the 'impact_schedule_minimum_days' and 'impact_schedule_likely_days' fields. Please review these fields in the DS16 Risk Register Tasks dataset to ensure that the minimum impact days are not exceeding the likely impact days. 

Correct values would have 'impact_schedule_minimum_days' less than or equal to 'impact_schedule_likely_days'. Any instances where the minimum days exceed the likely days should be corrected to maintain data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed on the 'DS16 Risk Register Tasks' table to ensure that the minimum impact days for the schedule are not greater than the likely impact days. The test is checking the logical consistency of the data, as it would not make sense for the minimum impact days to exceed the likely impact days. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the data is accurate and reliable. If the minimum impact days are greater than the likely days, it could lead to incorrect risk assessments and flawed project planning. This could potentially cause delays in the project timeline and increase costs. 

The severity of this test is marked as an ALERT. This means that while it may not immediately prevent the data from being reviewed, it could cause minor problems or indicate that the data does not follow best practices. It's a signal that the data should be reviewed for potential errors or inconsistencies.
