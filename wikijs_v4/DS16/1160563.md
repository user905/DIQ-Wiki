The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Likely Impact Cost Dollars Greater Than Max Dollars" is designed to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data in the DS16 Risk Register Tasks table. 

This check is specifically looking at two fields: 'impact_cost_likely_dollars' and 'impact_cost_max_dollars'. The test is checking to see if the value in the 'impact_cost_likely_dollars' field is greater than the value in the 'impact_cost_max_dollars' field. 

If the 'impact_cost_likely_dollars' is greater than the 'impact_cost_max_dollars', this would indicate a potential error in the data. The 'impact_cost_likely_dollars' should logically be less than or equal to the 'impact_cost_max_dollars'. 

If this error is found, it may be due to a data entry error or a calculation error in the source data. It is recommended to review the data in these fields for accuracy and make any necessary corrections to ensure the integrity and quality of the data in the DS16 Risk Register Tasks table.

This test is being performed on the 'DS16 Risk Register Tasks' table to ensure that the likely impact cost in dollars is not greater than the maximum impact cost in dollars. The importance of this check is to maintain the accuracy and consistency of the financial data related to the project's risk management. It helps in preventing any overestimation of the likely impact cost which could lead to incorrect financial planning and risk assessment.

The severity of this test is marked as 'ALERT', which means it is not a critical error but could potentially cause minor problems or indicate that the data does not follow all best practices. It is important to address this alert to ensure the integrity of the data and to avoid any potential issues during the analysis of the project's risk management data.
