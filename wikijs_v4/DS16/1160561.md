| Table       | DS16 Risk Register Tasks |
| Severity    | ALERT |
| Unique ID   | 1160561   |
| Summary     | Does this event task have an impact value on cost and/or schedule? |
| Error message | risk_task_type = Event & non-zero value found in impact_schedule_min_days, impact_schedule_likely_days, impact_schedule_max_days, impact_cost_min_dollars, impact_cost_likely_dollars, or impact_cost_max_dollars. |

## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Event With Impact" is designed to ensure that all event tasks in the DS16 Risk Register Tasks table have an associated impact value on either cost or schedule. 

The fields that are checked for this are 'impact_schedule_min_days', 'impact_schedule_likely_days', 'impact_schedule_max_days', 'impact_cost_min_dollars', 'impact_cost_likely_dollars', and 'impact_cost_max_dollars'. If any of these fields contain a non-zero value, it indicates that the event task has an impact on cost and/or schedule.

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it is likely because an event task has been entered without an associated impact value. This could be due to a data entry error or omission. 

To resolve this issue, review the event tasks in the DS16 Risk Register Tasks table and ensure that each one has an associated impact value on either cost or schedule. The expected values for these fields should be non-zero numbers.

This test is being performed on the 'DS16 Risk Register Tasks' table to ensure that all event tasks have an associated impact value on cost and/or schedule. The test checks if there is a non-zero value in any of the fields related to impact on schedule (in days) or impact on cost (in dollars). 

The importance of this check is to ensure that all risks associated with event tasks are properly quantified in terms of their potential impact on the project's cost and schedule. This is crucial for effective risk management and for making informed decisions about resource allocation and project planning. 

The severity of this check is classified as an 'ALERT', which means it is not a critical issue that would prevent the data from being reviewed. However, it does indicate that there might be minor problems or that the data does not fully adhere to best practices. If event tasks are found without an associated impact value, it could potentially lead to underestimation of risks and mismanagement of resources. Therefore, while it's not a critical error, it's still important to address this issue to ensure accurate and effective project management.
