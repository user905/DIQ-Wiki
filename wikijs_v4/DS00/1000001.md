The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CPP Status Date Missing From Cost Periods" is designed to ensure that the CPP Status Date from the DS00 Metadata table is included in the list of period dates in the DS03 Cost table. 

If the CPP Status Date is missing from the period dates, it could indicate an error in data entry or a discrepancy between the metadata and cost data. This could potentially lead to inaccuracies in project management and cost tracking.

The fields causing the issue are the 'cpp_status_date' field in the DS00 Metadata table and the 'period_date' field in the DS03 Cost table. The expected value is that the CPP Status Date should be present in the list of period dates. 

If the CPP Status Date is not found in the period dates, or if the CPP Status Date is later than the latest period date in the cost file, the DIQ check will flag this as a potential issue. This is to ensure that the cost periods are accurately reflecting the status of the project as indicated in the metadata.

This test is being performed to ensure that the CPP Status Date is included in the period dates in the cost file. The CPP Status Date is a critical piece of information that provides context about the status of the Cost Performance Plan (CPP) at a specific point in time. If this date is missing from the period dates in the cost file, it could lead to inaccuracies or misunderstandings about the status and progress of the CPP.

The severity of this check is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if this issue is not resolved, the data cannot be reviewed or analyzed accurately. It is crucial to fix this error to maintain the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data. This check is important because it ensures that all necessary data is present for accurate analysis and decision-making.
