Test Title: POP Start After POP Finish

Test Summary: This test checks if the Period of Performance (POP) start date on a transaction is later than the POP finish date in the DS10 CC Log Detail table.

Error Message: POP_start_date > POP_finish_date.

Explanation: This error occurs when the POP start date is later than the POP finish date. In a typical project timeline, the start date should always be earlier than or equal to the finish date. If the start date is later than the finish date, it indicates a data entry error or a system error.

Fields Causing the Issue: The fields causing this issue are the POP_start_date and POP_finish_date fields in the DS10 CC Log Detail table.

Expected Values: The expected value for the POP_start_date should be a date that is earlier than or equal to the POP_finish_date. If the start date is later than the finish date, it will trigger this error. 

To resolve this issue, review the entries in the POP_start_date and POP_finish_date fields for the affected transactions and correct any dates that are out of sequence.

This test is being performed on the 'DS10 CC Log Detail' table to check the integrity of the Period of Performance (POP) start and finish dates. The test is checking if the POP start date is later than the POP finish date, which should not be the case in a logically correct dataset. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the data related to the project's timeline is accurate and reliable. If the start date is later than the finish date, it could lead to incorrect analysis and misleading results about the project's duration and progress. This could further impact decision-making and planning processes.

The severity of this test is marked as 'WARNING', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis. Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue to maintain the quality and reliability of the project management data.
