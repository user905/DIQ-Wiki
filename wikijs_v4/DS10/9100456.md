| Summary     | Do the DB transaction hours for this Work Package sum to something other than the DB in cost? |

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "DB Hour Transactions Misaligned with Cost (WP)" is designed to ensure that the sum of transaction hours for a given Work Package in the DS10 CC Log Detail table aligns with the corresponding cost in the DS03 Cost table. 

The test is performed by comparing the sum of 'hours_delta' in the DS10 CC Log Detail table where the category is 'DB' (Direct Billing), with the sum of 'BCWSi_hours' in the DS03 Cost table. Both sums are grouped by the Work Package ID ('WBS_ID_WP' in DS03 and 'WBS_ID' in DS10).

If the sums do not match, it indicates a discrepancy between the recorded hours and the associated cost for a Work Package. This could be due to errors in data entry, such as incorrect logging of hours or misclassification of transactions under the 'DB' category. 

The expected values for 'hours_delta' in the DS10 CC Log Detail table and 'BCWSi_hours' in the DS03 Cost table should be equal for each Work Package when summed up. If they are not, the DIQ check will flag these records for review. 

Please ensure that all hours and costs are accurately recorded and classified in the respective tables to maintain data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed to ensure that the total hours recorded for a specific Work Package in the 'DS10 CC Log Detail' table align with the corresponding cost in the database. The test checks if the sum of 'hours_delta' where the category is 'DB' is not equal to the sum of 'DS03.BCWSi_hours' for the same Work Package (identified by 'WBS_ID_WP').

The importance of this check lies in maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data related to project management. If the hours and costs are misaligned, it could lead to incorrect analysis and decision-making based on this data. This could potentially impact the project's budgeting, scheduling, and overall management. 

The severity of this check is marked as 'WARNING', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue to ensure the reliability of the data and the subsequent analysis.
