The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Description Missing" is designed to identify any records in the DS10 CC Log Detail table where the 'description' field is either null or blank. 

The 'description' field is crucial for understanding the context and details of each record in the DS10 CC Log Detail table. If this field is missing or blank, it may lead to incomplete or misleading information about the record. 

The DIQ check is performed by examining each record in the DS10 CC Log Detail table. If the 'description' field is found to be null or blank (i.e., it contains no data or only whitespace), the record is flagged by the check.

To ensure data integrity and quality, it is important that all records in the DS10 CC Log Detail table have a valid, non-blank description. If this DIQ check flags any records, you should review the source data and ensure that a valid description is provided for each record.
