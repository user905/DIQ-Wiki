## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "EU Likely Days Greater Than Max" is performed on the DS18 Schedule EU table. This check is designed to ensure that the estimated likely duration of an activity (EU Likely Days) is not exceeding the maximum estimated duration (EU Max Days) for that activity.

If an error is flagged by this DIQ check, it indicates that there are instances where the value in the 'EU_likely_days' field is greater than the value in the 'EU_max_days' field. This is a discrepancy as logically, the likely duration of an activity should not exceed its maximum estimated duration.

To resolve this issue, you should review the entries in the 'EU_likely_days' and 'EU_max_days' fields for each activity in the DS18 Schedule EU table. Ensure that the value for 'EU_likely_days' is less than or equal to the value for 'EU_max_days'. If not, adjust the values accordingly to maintain data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed to ensure that the Estimated Ultimate (EU) likely days are not exceeding the maximum days in the DS18 Schedule EU table. The test is checking if the value of 'EU_likely_days' is greater than 'EU_max_days'. 

The importance of this check is to maintain the accuracy and consistency of the project schedule data. If the likely days to complete a task are greater than the maximum days allowed, it could indicate a potential scheduling issue or error in data entry. This could lead to inaccurate project timelines and misallocation of resources.

The severity of this test is marked as an ALERT. This means that while it's not a critical error that would prevent the data from being reviewed, it's still a potential issue that could cause minor problems or indicate that the data doesn't adhere to best practices. It's a signal to review the data and correct any discrepancies to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
