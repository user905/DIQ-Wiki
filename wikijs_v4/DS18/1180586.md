The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Schedule EU Lacking Spread" is designed to ensure that there is a range of expected durations for each task in the DS18 Schedule EU table. This range is represented by three fields: EU_min_days, EU_likely_days, and EU_max_days. 

The DIQ check is flagging an issue when all three of these fields have the same value for a given task. This is problematic because it indicates that there is no variation in the expected duration of the task. In other words, the minimum, likely, and maximum durations are all the same, which is not realistic for most tasks in a construction project. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that the values entered for EU_min_days, EU_likely_days, and EU_max_days reflect a realistic range of durations for each task. The EU_min_days should represent the shortest possible duration, the EU_max_days should represent the longest possible duration, and the EU_likely_days should represent the most probable duration. These three values should not be equal for any given task.

This test is being performed on the 'DS18 Schedule EU' table to check if the minimum, likely, and maximum days for each EU (Element of Work) are all equal. This is important because in project management, especially in construction, it's crucial to have a spread in the estimated duration of tasks to account for uncertainties and risks. If all these values are equal, it suggests that no variability or uncertainty has been considered in the project scheduling, which is not a realistic approach.

The severity of this test is marked as an 'ALERT', which is less severe but indicates that there might be minor problems or that the data doesn't follow all best practices. In this case, the lack of spread in the estimated duration of tasks might not cause immediate problems, but it could lead to inaccuracies in the project schedule and risk analysis. Therefore, it's important to address this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
