The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CD-3 Milestone Missing in Baseline" is designed to verify the presence of the CD-3 milestone in the baseline schedule of the DS04 Schedule table. 

The CD-3 milestone is a critical component of the project schedule, and its absence could indicate a significant oversight in project planning. This milestone is identified by a milestone level of 150 in the DS04 Schedule table. 

The DIQ check is performed by counting the number of rows in the DS04 Schedule table where the schedule type is 'BL' (indicating a baseline schedule) and the milestone level is 150 (indicating a CD-3 milestone). If the count is zero, this means that the CD-3 milestone is missing from the baseline schedule.

If you encounter an error message stating "No row found for CD-3 milestone (milestone_level = 150) in baseline schedule (schedule_type = BL)", this indicates that the CD-3 milestone is not present in the baseline schedule. To resolve this issue, you should review your project schedule and ensure that the CD-3 milestone is included in the baseline schedule with the correct milestone level of 150.

This test is being performed to check if the baseline schedule in the DS04 Schedule table is missing the CD-3 milestone. The CD-3 milestone is a critical decision point in the project management process, marking the approval of the project's execution phase. 

The severity of this test is marked as a WARNING, which implies that the absence of this milestone could potentially cause problems during the analysis of the project's progress and performance. It is important to have all the milestones in the baseline schedule to ensure accurate tracking and evaluation of the project's progress against its planned objectives. 

The absence of the CD-3 milestone could lead to inaccurate project performance assessments, misalignment in project execution, and potential delays in project completion. Therefore, this check is crucial to maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.
