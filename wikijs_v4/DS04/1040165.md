The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Insufficient Description" is designed to ensure that each task in the DS04 Schedule table has a proper description. This check is important because a well-defined task description is crucial for clear communication and effective project management.

The DIQ check identifies tasks that are lacking a proper description. Specifically, it flags tasks where the description field contains less than two words. This is based on the assumption that a meaningful description of a task would require at least two words.

If this DIQ check flags any tasks, it means that those tasks have insufficient descriptions. The issue lies in the 'description' field of the DS04 Schedule table. The expected value for this field is a string of at least two words. 

To resolve this issue, review the flagged tasks and update their descriptions to be more detailed and informative. This will not only pass the DIQ check but also improve the overall quality and clarity of the project schedule.

This test is being performed to ensure that each task in the 'DS04 Schedule' table has a proper description. The importance of this check is to maintain the clarity and understanding of each task. Without a sufficient description, it can lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the task's purpose, which can negatively impact the project's execution and management. The severity level of this test is 'ALERT', which means it's not a critical issue, but it's still important to follow best practices for data quality and integrity. It's recommended to have at least two words in the task description to provide enough context about the task.
