The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "CD-2 Milestone Missing in Forecast" is designed to ensure that your forecast schedule in the DS04 Schedule table includes the CD-2 milestone. 

The CD-2 milestone is a critical component of the project management process, and its absence could indicate a significant oversight in the project planning phase. This milestone is identified by a milestone level of 130 in the DS04 Schedule table.

The error message "No row found for CD-2 milestone (milestone_level = 130) in forecast schedule (schedule_type = FC)" is triggered when the DIQ check does not find any row in the DS04 Schedule table where the milestone level is 130 and the schedule type is 'FC' (indicating a forecast schedule).

To resolve this issue, please ensure that your forecast schedule includes the CD-2 milestone with the correct milestone level (130) and schedule type ('FC').

This test is being performed to ensure that the forecast schedule for the DS04 Schedule table includes the CD-2 milestone. The CD-2 milestone, or Critical Decision-2, is a crucial part of the project management process in the Department of Energy. It signifies the approval of the performance baseline, which includes the project's cost, schedule, and scope. 

The severity of this test is marked as a WARNING. This means that while the absence of the CD-2 milestone in the forecast schedule may not immediately prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis of the project's progress and future forecasting. 

The importance of this check lies in its ability to ensure that all necessary milestones are included in the forecast schedule. This is crucial for accurate project management and forecasting. If the CD-2 milestone is missing, it could indicate a problem with the data entry or a potential oversight in project planning. Therefore, this check helps maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.
