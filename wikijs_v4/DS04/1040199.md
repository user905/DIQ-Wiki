The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Completed Task Missing Actual Finish" is designed to identify any tasks in the DS04 Schedule table that are marked as completed (either by physical, units, or duration percentage being 100%) but do not have an associated Actual Finish date.

The fields involved in this check are 'PC_duration', 'PC_physical', 'PC_units', and 'AF_date'. The 'PC_duration', 'PC_physical', and 'PC_units' fields represent the percentage of completion for the task's duration, physical progress, and units, respectively. If any of these fields have a value of 1 (indicating 100% completion), the task is considered completed. The 'AF_date' field represents the actual finish date of the task.

The error message "Task with a physical, units, or duration % complete = 1 (pc_physical, pc_units, pc_duration) missing Actual Finish (AF_Date)" indicates that there is a task that is marked as completed but does not have an associated Actual Finish date. This could be due to a data entry error or omission.

The expected values for a completed task would be 1 for either 'PC_duration', 'PC_physical', or 'PC_units', and a valid date for 'AF_date'. If a task is marked as completed, it should always have an associated Actual Finish date. If this is not the case, the data may need to be corrected or updated.

This test is being performed to ensure that all completed tasks in the 'DS04 Schedule' table have an actual finish date recorded. The test checks if there are any tasks that are marked as 100% complete (in terms of physical completion, units, or duration) but do not have an 'Actual Finish' date. 

The importance of this check is to maintain the accuracy and completeness of the project schedule data. Without an actual finish date, it would be difficult to track the project's progress accurately, analyze the efficiency of task completion, and make informed decisions for future planning. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'WARNING', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. It is crucial to address this issue to ensure the reliability of the project management data.
