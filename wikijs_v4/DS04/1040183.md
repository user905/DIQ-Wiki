The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Insufficient High Float Justification" is performed on the DS04 Schedule table. This check is designed to ensure that each task with a high float value has a sufficient justification. 

The error message "High float justification was insufficient (lacking at least two words)" indicates that the justification provided for a high float value is not adequate. This is likely because the justification field, labeled as 'justification_float_high', does not contain at least two words. 

The DIQ check is looking for a space character in the 'justification_float_high' field, which would indicate the presence of at least two words. If no space character is found, the check determines that the justification is insufficient. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that each task with a high float value in the DS04 Schedule table includes a justification that is at least two words long. This will provide adequate context and explanation for the high float value.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check for sufficient justification for tasks with high float. High float refers to the amount of time that you can delay a task without it causing a delay to subsequent tasks or the project completion date. The test is checking if there is enough explanation or reasoning provided for these tasks with high float.

The importance of this check is to ensure that tasks with high float are not being overlooked or mismanaged. If a task has a high float, it means it has a lot of flexibility in its scheduling. However, this doesn't mean it can be ignored or not properly planned for. Without sufficient justification, it could indicate potential issues with project scheduling and management.

The severity of this check is an 'ALERT', which is less severe. It indicates that there might be minor problems or that the data doesn't follow all best practices. While it may not immediately cause problems during analysis, it's a good practice to provide sufficient justification for tasks with high float to ensure proper project management and scheduling.
