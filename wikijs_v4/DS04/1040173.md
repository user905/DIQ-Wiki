The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Early Start Later Than Early Finish" is performed on the DS04 Schedule table. This check is designed to ensure that the early start date (ES_date) of a task is not later than the early finish date (EF_date). 

If an error is flagged by this check, it indicates that there is an inconsistency in the scheduling data. Specifically, the issue lies in the ES_date and EF_date fields. The expected value should be such that the ES_date is earlier than or equal to the EF_date. 

This error could be caused by a data entry mistake or a system error during data import. It is important to correct this error to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the project schedule data.

This test is being performed to ensure that the start date of a task or project is not later than its finish date in the DS04 Schedule table. This is a logical inconsistency as a task cannot finish before it starts. The importance of this check is to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the project schedule data. It helps in preventing potential issues during project execution and analysis. The severity level is marked as WARNING, which means that while it may not immediately prevent data review, it is likely to cause problems during analysis and should be addressed promptly.
