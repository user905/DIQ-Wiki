The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "BL Task With Negative Total Float" is designed to identify any instances in the DS04 Schedule table where a Baseline (BL) task has a negative total float. 

The total float of a task, represented by the field 'float_total_days', is the amount of time that you can delay a task without delaying the project. More time means more flexibility. Therefore, a negative total float could indicate a problem with the project schedule, as it suggests that the task is or will be behind schedule.

This DIQ check is looking for instances where 'float_total_days' is less than 0 and where the 'schedule_type' is 'BL'. If such instances are found, it means that there are Baseline tasks with a negative total float, which could potentially delay the project. 

To resolve this issue, review the tasks in the DS04 Schedule table, particularly those marked as 'BL' in the 'schedule_type' field. Ensure that the 'float_total_days' for these tasks is a non-negative value. This will help maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check for any Baseline (BL) tasks that have a negative total float. The total float of a task refers to the amount of time that you can delay a task without delaying the project. More specifically, it's checking for any instances where 'float_total_days' is less than zero. 

The importance of this check is high, as indicated by the severity level of 'ERROR'. Having a negative total float is a serious issue in project management as it indicates that the task is behind schedule. If not addressed, it could lead to delays in the overall project timeline. Therefore, this issue must be fixed before the data can be reviewed further. This check ensures that the project is on track and helps in maintaining the integrity and quality of the project management data.
