The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Approve Finish Project Milestone Missing in Baseline" is designed to ensure that your baseline schedule includes the "approve finish project milestone". This check is performed on the DS04 Schedule table.

If you receive a message stating "No row found for approve finish project milestone (milestone_level = 199) in baseline schedule (schedule_type = BL)", it means that the DIQ check did not find the required milestone in your baseline schedule. 

The fields causing this issue are 'milestone_level' and 'schedule_type'. The 'milestone_level' field should have a value of 199, which represents the "approve finish project milestone". The 'schedule_type' field should have a value of 'BL', indicating that the schedule is a baseline schedule.

To resolve this issue, ensure that your baseline schedule includes the "approve finish project milestone" with the correct 'milestone_level' and 'schedule_type' values.

This test is being performed to ensure that the baseline schedule for the EVMS construction project includes the 'approve finish project' milestone. The 'approve finish project' milestone is a critical point in the project timeline that signifies the completion and approval of the project. 

The importance of this check is high, as indicated by the severity level of 'ERROR'. If this milestone is missing, it could lead to significant issues in project management and oversight, such as inaccurate tracking of project progress, miscommunication among stakeholders, and potential delays in project completion. 

Without this milestone, it would be impossible to accurately determine if the project has been completed as per the approved schedule. Therefore, this issue must be fixed before the data can be reviewed further.
