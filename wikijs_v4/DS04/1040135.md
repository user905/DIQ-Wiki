The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WBS With Only ZBA Tasks" is designed to verify the task subtypes within the DS04 Schedule table. Specifically, it checks whether a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) contains only tasks of subtype 'ZBA'. 

An error message "WBS has no other task subtype other than ZBA (subtype = ZBA)" will be triggered if a WBS is found to contain only tasks of subtype 'ZBA'. This could be due to an error in data entry or a lack of diversity in task types within a particular WBS. 

The fields causing this issue are 'WBS_ID', 'schedule_type', and 'subtype'. The 'WBS_ID' and 'schedule_type' fields are used to identify the specific WBS and schedule type being checked. The 'subtype' field is checked to determine the type of tasks within the WBS. 

The expected values for the 'subtype' field would be a variety of task subtypes, not just 'ZBA'. If a variety of task subtypes are present within a WBS, the DIQ check will pass successfully. If only 'ZBA' tasks are found, the check will fail and the error message will be triggered. 

Please ensure that each WBS contains a variety of task subtypes to maintain data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check if a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) only contains Zero Budget Allocation (ZBA) tasks. The severity level is 'WARNING', which means that while it's not an immediate threat to data integrity, it could potentially cause problems during data analysis.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring a balanced and diverse task allocation within a WBS. If a WBS only contains ZBA tasks, it might indicate a lack of variety in task types, which could lead to an imbalance in resource allocation and project management. This could potentially skew the project's budgeting and scheduling, leading to inaccurate project forecasting and planning. Therefore, this check is crucial for maintaining the quality and integrity of the project management data.
