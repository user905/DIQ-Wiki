The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Contract Completion Milestone Missing in Baseline" is designed to ensure that your baseline schedule in the DS04 Schedule table includes the Contract Completion milestone. 

The error message "No row found for Contract Completion milestone (milestone_level = 180) in baseline schedule (schedule_type = BL)" indicates that the Contract Completion milestone, which should be represented by a milestone level of 180, is missing from your baseline schedule. 

The baseline schedule is identified by the schedule type 'BL'. If this milestone is missing, it means that the baseline schedule does not contain a complete representation of all the milestones required for the project, which could lead to inaccurate project tracking and reporting.

To resolve this issue, please ensure that your baseline schedule includes a row for the Contract Completion milestone with a milestone level of 180.

This test is being performed to check if the baseline schedule in the DS04 Schedule table is missing the Contract Completion milestone. The Contract Completion milestone is a critical component of project management as it signifies the official end of the contract and triggers the final payment and other contractual obligations. 

The severity of this test is marked as a WARNING. This means that while the absence of this milestone may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. The milestone provides a clear endpoint for the project and its absence could lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the project timeline and completion status. 

Therefore, this check is important to ensure that all necessary milestones are included in the baseline schedule for accurate and effective project management. It helps maintain the integrity and quality of the project management data by ensuring that all key components of the project timeline are accounted for.
