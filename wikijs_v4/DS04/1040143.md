The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Actual Start Later Than Actual Finish" is designed to identify any tasks in the DS04 Schedule table that have an Actual Start date (AS_date) that is later than the Actual Finish date (AF_date). This check is specifically for tasks with a schedule type of 'FC'.

If this DIQ check identifies any tasks, it indicates an error in the data. The likely cause of this error is incorrect data entry. The Actual Start date of a task should always be earlier than or equal to the Actual Finish date. If the Actual Start date is later, it suggests that the dates have been entered in the wrong order or that there is a mistake in one or both of the dates.

To resolve this issue, review the tasks identified by the DIQ check and correct the dates as necessary. Ensure that the Actual Start date is not later than the Actual Finish date for any task.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check for any inconsistencies in the task scheduling data. Specifically, it is looking for instances where the 'Actual Start' date of a task is later than the 'Actual Finish' date. This is a logical impossibility in project management as a task cannot finish before it starts.

The severity of this test is marked as 'WARNING', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. This is because such inconsistencies can lead to incorrect calculations of project timelines, durations, and dependencies, which can in turn affect the overall project management and decision-making process.

The importance of this check lies in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the project scheduling data. It helps to identify and correct any data entry errors or system glitches that may have led to such inconsistencies, thereby improving the overall data integrity and quality. This is crucial for maintaining the credibility of the EVMS construction project management data at the US Department of Energy.
