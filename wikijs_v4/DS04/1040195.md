The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Milestone Typed Improperly" is designed to ensure that all milestones in the DS04 Schedule table are correctly classified as either a start milestone (SM) or finish milestone (FM). 

The error message "Milestone level has been provided but tasks type is not either SM or FM" indicates that there are entries in the DS04 Schedule table where a milestone level has been specified, but the corresponding task type is not classified as either 'SM' or 'FM'. 

This discrepancy could be due to a data entry error or a misclassification of the task type. To resolve this issue, review the entries in the DS04 Schedule table, specifically the 'type' field, and ensure that all tasks associated with a milestone level are correctly classified as either 'SM' or 'FM'.

This test, titled "Milestone Typed Improperly," is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to ensure that the milestones in the project schedule are correctly classified as either start (SM) or finish (FM) milestones. The test has raised a warning because a milestone level has been provided, but the task type is not classified as either SM or FM. 

The importance of this check lies in the accurate representation and tracking of project milestones. In project management, milestones are crucial points that mark major events or a significant change in the project. If they are not correctly classified, it could lead to confusion, miscommunication, and potential delays in the project timeline. 

The severity level of this test is a warning, which implies that while it may not immediately prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during the analysis of the project's progress and could potentially impact decision-making processes. Therefore, it is recommended to address this issue promptly to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
