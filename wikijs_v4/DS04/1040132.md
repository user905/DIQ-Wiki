## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "SVT with EVT" is designed to verify the presence of an Earned Value Technique (EVT) for each Schedule Variance Technique (SVT) in the DS04 Schedule table. 

The error message "SVT found with EVT" indicates that there is an SVT entry in the DS04 Schedule table that does not have a corresponding EVT entry. This could be due to a data entry error or omission during the data input process.

The fields causing the issue are the 'subtype' field, which should contain the SVT, and the 'EVT' field, which should contain the corresponding EVT. Both fields should not be empty. 

The expected values for these fields would be the appropriate SVT and EVT codes as per the project management guidelines. If an SVT is present, a corresponding EVT should also be present in the data. 

To resolve this issue, please ensure that each SVT entry in the DS04 Schedule table has a corresponding EVT entry.

This test is being performed on the 'DS04 Schedule' table to check if a Scheduled Value of Task (SVT) has an associated Earned Value of Task (EVT). The test is titled 'SVT with EVT' and it has a severity level of 'WARNING', which means that if an SVT is found without an EVT, it could potentially cause problems during data analysis.

The importance of this check lies in the fact that in project management, especially in Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS), both SVT and EVT are crucial for tracking project performance and progress. SVT represents the planned cost of work scheduled, while EVT represents the value of work actually performed. If an SVT does not have an associated EVT, it could indicate a discrepancy in the project's progress tracking, which could lead to inaccurate project performance analysis and forecasting. Therefore, this check is essential to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
