The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "WBS Misaligned Between FC & BL" is designed to identify any discrepancies between the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) IDs in the Forecast (FC) and Baseline (BL) schedules within the DS04 Schedule table. 

The WBS ID is a critical field that should align between the FC and BL schedules for each task. If the WBS ID does not match for a given task, it indicates a potential data integrity issue. This could be due to a data entry error, a change in the WBS structure that was not properly updated in both schedules, or a system error during data import or export.

The DIQ check works by comparing the WBS IDs for each task in the FC and BL schedules. If it finds a task where the WBS IDs do not match, it flags that task for review. 

To resolve this issue, you should review the flagged tasks and ensure that the WBS IDs are correctly aligned in both the FC and BL schedules. If necessary, correct the WBS IDs in the DS04 Schedule table to ensure data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed to ensure that the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ID is consistent between the Forecast (FC) and Baseline (BL) schedules in the DS04 Schedule table. The WBS ID is a critical element in project management that helps in organizing tasks, assigning responsibilities, and tracking project progress. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if the WBS ID does not align between the FC and BL schedules for a particular task, it is a critical issue that must be fixed before the data can be reviewed. 

The importance of this check lies in its potential to disrupt the entire project management process. Misalignment between the FC and BL schedules could lead to confusion, miscommunication, and errors in project execution and tracking. It could also cause problems during data analysis, as the data from the two schedules would not match. Therefore, ensuring data integrity and quality in this aspect is crucial for the successful management and completion of the EVMS construction project.
