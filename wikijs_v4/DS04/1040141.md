The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Missing Apportioned To Task ID" is designed to identify any instances in the DS04 Schedule table where an apportioned task is missing an associated task ID. 

An apportioned task is identified by an EVT value of either 'J' or 'M'. The task ID for these tasks should be recorded in the field 'EVT_J_to_task_ID'. This DIQ check is looking for any instances where this field is empty for apportioned tasks.

If this DIQ check returns any records, it indicates that there are apportioned tasks in the DS04 Schedule table that do not have an associated task ID recorded in the 'EVT_J_to_task_ID' field. This could be due to a data entry error or omission during the data input process. 

To resolve this issue, you should review the identified records and ensure that each apportioned task has a corresponding task ID recorded in the 'EVT_J_to_task_ID' field.

This test is being performed to ensure that all apportioned tasks in the DS04 Schedule table have an associated 'Apportioned To Task ID'. The 'Apportioned To Task ID' is crucial as it links the apportioned task to the specific task it is apportioned to. Without this ID, it would be impossible to accurately track or manage the apportioned tasks, leading to potential issues in project management and data analysis.

The severity of this check is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if this issue is not resolved, the data cannot be reviewed or used for further analysis. It is essential to fix this issue to maintain the integrity and quality of the EVMS construction project management data. This check is important because it ensures that all tasks are properly linked and accounted for, which is crucial for accurate project management and reporting.
