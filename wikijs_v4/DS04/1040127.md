| Table       | DS04 Schedule |
| Severity    | WARNING |
| Unique ID   | 1040127   |
| Summary     | Does this milestone have a non-zero duration? |
| Error message | Milestone with original, actual, or remaining duration > 0 (duration_original_days, duration_actual_days, or duration_remaining_days), or where Start and Finish dates are not aligned (ES_date/EF_date, LS_date/LF_date, AS_date/AF_date). |

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Milestone with Non-Zero Duration" is performed on the DS04 Schedule table. This check is designed to identify any milestones that have a non-zero duration. 

In the context of project management, a milestone typically represents a significant event or a point in time and does not have a duration. Therefore, the fields 'duration_original_days', 'duration_actual_days', and 'duration_remaining_days' for a milestone should ideally be zero. If these fields have a value greater than zero, it indicates an error.

Additionally, the start and finish dates for a milestone should be the same. This check also identifies any discrepancies in the alignment of start and finish dates. The fields 'ES_date' and 'EF_date' represent the early start and early finish dates, 'LS_date' and 'LF_date' represent the late start and late finish dates, and 'AS_date' and 'AF_date' represent the actual start and finish dates. If the start and finish dates in any of these pairs are not the same, it indicates an error.

In summary, this DIQ check is designed to ensure that all milestones in the DS04 Schedule table have zero duration and aligned start and finish dates. Any discrepancies identified by this check could be due to data entry errors or incorrect scheduling and should be investigated and corrected to maintain data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed to ensure that milestones in the DS04 Schedule table have a zero duration. In project management, a milestone typically represents a significant event or achievement that does not consume any time or resources. Therefore, it should have a zero duration. 

The test checks if there are any milestones with original, actual, or remaining duration greater than zero, or where the Start and Finish dates are not aligned. If such instances are found, a warning is issued. 

The importance of this check is to maintain the accuracy and consistency of the project schedule data. If milestones are incorrectly recorded with non-zero durations, it could distort the project timeline and misrepresent the project's progress. This could lead to incorrect decisions being made based on this data. 

The severity of this check is marked as a warning, which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. Therefore, it is recommended to correct this issue to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data.
