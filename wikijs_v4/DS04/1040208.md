The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Approve Start Project Milestone Missing in Baseline" is designed to verify the presence of the "approve start project milestone" in your baseline schedule in the DS04 Schedule table. 

The error message "No row found for approve start project milestone (milestone_level = 100) in baseline schedule (schedule_type = BL)" indicates that the DIQ check did not find any row in the DS04 Schedule table where the milestone_level is 100 (which represents the "approve start project milestone") and the schedule_type is 'BL' (which represents the baseline schedule).

The likely cause of this error is that the baseline schedule in the DS04 Schedule table is missing the "approve start project milestone". This could be due to an oversight during data entry or a problem with the data import process.

To resolve this issue, ensure that your baseline schedule includes the "approve start project milestone" with a milestone_level of 100. If the milestone is present but the milestone_level or schedule_type fields are incorrect, these should be corrected to the expected values (milestone_level = 100, schedule_type = 'BL').

This test is being performed to ensure that the 'Approve Start Project Milestone' is present in the baseline schedule of the DS04 Schedule table. The baseline schedule is a critical component of project management as it serves as a reference point for the project's progress. The 'Approve Start Project Milestone' is a significant event in the project timeline, marking the official commencement of the project. 

The severity of this test is marked as 'ERROR', which is the highest level of severity. This means that if the 'Approve Start Project Milestone' is missing from the baseline schedule, it is a critical issue that must be addressed immediately. Without this milestone, the project cannot be properly tracked or managed, and the data cannot be reviewed. 

Therefore, this check is of utmost importance to ensure the integrity and quality of the project management data. It ensures that all necessary milestones are included in the baseline schedule, allowing for accurate tracking and management of the project.
