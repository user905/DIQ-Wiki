The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "LOE Task With Improper Logic" is designed to identify any Level of Effort (LOE) tasks in the DS04 Schedule table that are missing at least one Finish-to-Finish (FF) and Start-to-Start (SS) predecessor. These predecessors should be discrete tasks, meaning they are not LOE tasks and do not have an Event Type (EVT) of 'A', 'K', or 'M'.

The error message "DS04.type = LOE or DS04.EVT = A without DS05.type = FF and SS relationships" indicates that the DIQ check has identified a LOE task or a task with an EVT of 'A' in the DS04 Schedule table that does not have the required FF and SS relationships in the DS05 Schedule Logic table.

This error is likely caused by incomplete or incorrect data entry. For example, a LOE task may have been entered into the DS04 Schedule table without the corresponding FF and SS relationships being entered into the DS05 Schedule Logic table. Alternatively, the FF and SS relationships may have been entered, but they may not be associated with discrete tasks.

To resolve this error, review the LOE tasks and their associated relationships in the DS04 Schedule and DS05 Schedule Logic tables. Ensure that each LOE task has at least one FF and SS predecessor, and that these predecessors are discrete tasks.

This test is being performed to ensure that Level of Effort (LOE) tasks in the DS04 Schedule table have the correct logic applied. Specifically, it checks if each LOE task has at least one Finish-to-Finish (FF) and Start-to-Start (SS) predecessor, both of which should be discrete tasks. 

The importance of this check is to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the project schedule. LOE tasks are ongoing tasks that span the duration of the project and their scheduling is dependent on other tasks. If they lack the proper FF and SS relationships, it could lead to inaccuracies in the project timeline and potentially cause delays or inefficiencies.

The severity of this check is marked as an ALERT. This means that while it may not immediately prevent data review or cause significant problems during analysis, it could potentially lead to minor issues or indicate that the data does not fully adhere to best practices. Therefore, it is recommended to address this issue to ensure optimal data quality and project management efficiency.
