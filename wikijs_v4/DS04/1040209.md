The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Approve Start Project Milestone Missing in Forecast" is designed to ensure that your forecast schedule, as recorded in the DS04 Schedule table, includes the approved start project milestone. 

This milestone is crucial for project planning and tracking, and its absence could lead to inaccurate forecasting and project management issues. The milestone is identified by a milestone level of 100. 

If this DIQ check fails, it means that there is no row in the DS04 Schedule table where the milestone level is 100 and the schedule type is 'FC' (indicating a forecast schedule). 

To resolve this issue, please ensure that your forecast schedule includes the approved start project milestone with the correct milestone level (100).
