# DS04
This data set should be populated with the project's contractor BL and FC IMS tool data for the entire span of the project (not the contract).<br/> Provide the contractor BL and FC IMS tool data by task.<br/> There should be alignment between the BL and FC IMSs.

| type | Task type selection:<br/> • TD = task dependent. Task is scheduled using its task calendar.<br/> • RD = resource dependent. Task is scheduled using its resource calendar(s).<br/> • LOE = level of effort. Task duration by its dependent taks. Used for administration type tasks. Use should be limited. Likely DS04.EVT = A (level of effort) but could be different.<br/> • SM = start milestone. Tasks with 0 duration and no resources. <br/> • FM = finish milestone.
