The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "EOC Combo Misaligned with Cost" is designed to ensure that the combination of resource Estimate at Completion (EOC) for a specific task or Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in the DS06 Resources table aligns with the EOCs in the DS03 Cost table. 

If an error message is received stating "Combo of resource EOCs for this DS04.task's WBS ID do not align with combo of DS03 EOCs", it indicates that there is a mismatch between the EOCs listed for a specific task or WBS in the DS06 Resources table and the EOCs listed in the DS03 Cost table. 

This discrepancy could be due to a variety of reasons such as data entry errors, updates in one table not being reflected in the other, or inconsistencies in the way EOCs are being assigned to tasks or WBSs. 

To resolve this issue, it is recommended to review the EOCs listed for the specific task or WBS in both the DS06 Resources and DS03 Cost tables. Ensure that the EOCs are consistent across both tables. If there are any discrepancies, they should be corrected to ensure data integrity and quality.

This test is being performed to ensure that the combination of resource Estimate at Completion (EOC) for a specific task or Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) aligns with the cost data. The test is checking the 'DS06 Resources' table and comparing the EOCs for a task's WBS ID in the 'DS04' table with the EOCs in the 'DS03' table. 

The importance of this check is to ensure that the estimated costs of resources for a task or WBS are accurately reflected in the cost data. Misalignment could lead to inaccurate cost projections, budget overruns, or incorrect resource allocation. 

The severity of this check is marked as a 'WARNING', which means that while it may not prevent the data from being reviewed, it is likely to cause problems during analysis. It is crucial to address this issue to ensure accurate and reliable project management data.

### Changelog

| Date       | Description of Changes   |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 2024-04-30 | 1. Logic adjusted to account for the addition of 'is_indirect' field. All cases where 'is_indirect' = 'Y' are treated as indirect data.
2. Logic adjusted to account for the addition of 'subproject_id' field.
3. Logic adjusted to include EOC in test. |
