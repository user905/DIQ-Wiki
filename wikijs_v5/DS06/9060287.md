The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "Resource Labor Performance Misaligned with Cost" is designed to identify discrepancies between the labor performance units recorded in the DS06 Resources table and the cost labor performance hours recorded in the DS03 Cost table.

The test is specifically looking for instances where the actual units of labor (where the type or EOC is 'Labor') in the DS06 Resources table do not match the sum of the cost labor performance hours (where EOC is 'Labor') in the DS03 Cost table.

If this DIQ test returns any records, it indicates that there is a misalignment between the labor performance units and the cost labor performance hours. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as data entry errors, incorrect allocation of labor hours, or discrepancies in the way labor hours are recorded in different tables.

The fields causing the issue are the 'actual_units' field in the DS06 Resources table and the 'BCWPi_hours' field in the DS03 Cost table. The expected values for these fields should be equal for each corresponding record, indicating that the labor performance units are correctly aligned with the cost labor performance hours.

To resolve any issues identified by this DIQ test, you would need to review the labor performance units and cost labor performance hours for each record returned by the test and correct any discrepancies.

This test is being performed to ensure that the resource labor performance units are correctly aligned with the cost labor performance hours. In the context of EVMS (Earned Value Management System), this is crucial as it directly impacts the cost performance index (CPI) and schedule performance index (SPI), which are key indicators of project health.

The test checks if the actual units of labor (where EOC or type equals Labor) are not equal to the sum of the cost labor performance hours (where EOC equals Labor). If these two values are not equal, it could indicate that there are discrepancies in the labor cost calculations, which could lead to inaccurate project cost and schedule performance assessments.

The severity of this check is marked as a WARNING. This means that while the data can still be reviewed, any discrepancies found could potentially cause problems during the analysis of the project's performance. It's important to address these issues to ensure accurate and reliable project management data.
