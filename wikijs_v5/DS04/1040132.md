| Table         | DS04 Schedule                              |
| Severity      | WARNING                                    |
| Unique ID     | 1040132                                    |
| Summary       | Does this SVT or ZBA have an EVT?          |
| Error message | subtype = SVT or ZBA and EVT is not blank. |

## What causes this error?

The Data Integrity and Quality (DIQ) check titled "SVT or ZBA with EVT" is designed to verify that tasks in the DS04 Schedule table marked as SVT or ZBA do not have an associated EVT.

The error is caused when the 'subtype' field contains either 'SVT' or 'ZBA', and the 'EVT' field contains one of its allowed values.

Correct the issue by removing either the EVT or the subtype.

## Why do we check this?

- Schedule Visibility Tasks (SVT): A non-PMB task for visibility/functionality to charactarize potential impacts to the logic-driven network.
- Zero Budget Activity (ZBA): Representative of subcontract payment tasks. Non-resource loaded.

These tasks/activities are for visibility purposes only, and should not represent a packet of work. EVTs should therefore not be assigned.

## Code

```sql

CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[fnDIQ_DS04_Sched_DoesEVTExistOnSVTOrZBA] (
	@upload_id int = 0
)
RETURNS TABLE
AS RETURN
(

	SELECT
		*
	FROM
		DS04_schedule
	WHERE
			upload_id = @upload_ID
		AND ISNULL(subtype,'') <> ''
		AND ISNULL(EVT,'') <> ''
)
```
